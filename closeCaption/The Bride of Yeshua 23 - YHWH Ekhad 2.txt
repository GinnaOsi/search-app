shabbat shalom lineage of the eternal

truth and friends accompanying us on

this so radiant day of Shabbat coming at

you from California the US of A we shall

enjoy together

another study about our Elohim today is

the 2nd of Sivan we have entered into

the third month and yahwah's calendar

we're in the year five thousand nine

hundred and eighty seven in other words

there are twelve years left and a little

more in order for it to get to the

entire apex of the pyramid and for the

six days of creation to end the six

millennial years so there is a maximum

time lapse of twelve years and a little

more that's if he asure wants to force

it to the very minute which I don't

believe is the case well there you have

a time lapse there which is special this

corresponds to the Gregorian calendar

with the 16th of June of the year 2018

and today we shall study the bride of

you should 23 Yahweh a HOD - and we're

gonna get at least three or four and

maybe even more than that because this

subject is absolutely fascinating

crucial which we must understand that's

if we want to follow the lamb

whithersoever he goeth we are living

somewhat 70 we've already lived 54

Shabbats this is cheb at number 54 and

as I've already said this year being as

it has an extra month

it's got 55 Chabot's sown extra bet is

the last one and forevermore we say

goodbye to shovel number 70 and the very

next day in other words in seven days in

Lemoore the next day we shall enter into

chef wat shovel at number 71

so we're eight days away actually it's

less if we count what we have of the

Shabbat as an entire day eight days to

enter into Shawa number 71 what will

happen we do not know what

will happen but we do know that great

things are happening in the world which

have not stopped nor detained so then

all we know that will happen is that

we're drawing ever near because we know

we're 12 years away in a little more and

but yahwah decides of when he enters

into Shabbat although we officially

enter into Shabbat within 12 years and

sometime

Yahweh can finish the creation because

we're in creation still so he has to be

done with creation and then he gets

pretty disposed and turn turns to

Shabbat that fulfills all the prophecies

that after the 70 begins the destruction

when it is not exactly declared we're on

the countdown of the omer we're on day

42 of the sixth week

tomorrow will be seventh week the last

week but it'll be day 43 in other words

today is the sixth week day 42 farewell

them just as you are let us address our

Creator beloved yahwah that art in

heaven hallowed be thy name

Lord we thank thee for they'll give us

this life and I'll give us this the

opportunity of continuing to learn about

thee I ask you Lord that what we read in

scripture today that those parables

which you pronounced can arrive at our

heart and we may comprehend them I ask

you Lord that you bless us and prepare

us and that you soon come and gather us

Lord we desire that in turn to Shabbat

soon and we'll wish for this creation to

already arrive at its end and that we

may prepare ourselves for this new

millennium which which is soon to begin

all this I asked for in the precious

name of Yeshua HaMashiach the Lord has

blessed with another year of life the

following friends of the eternal truth

Jenny Karolina Castro real

Mexico I release Herrera Venezuela

Alfredo Acosta paisa El Salvador and

Sara Isabel Garcia the US of A many

blessings and congratulations to

everyone of you members of the eternal

truth proverbs 25:2 a text that we've

read innumerable times but it is a text

that's so magnificent because it talks

about how the glory of Allah Hemus to

conceal the word how is it that the

glory of Elohim is to conceal the word

instead of the word being clear instead

of it being precise instead of it being

absolutely easy to understand

it says not at the glory which is the

glory that it is all hidden concealed

that cannot be understood but the honor

of the king it is of the kings is to

search the word and the word must be

searched for it is written in parables

we've been studying a subject which has

changed forever the way we had of

thinking and today what I'll say today

will affect many of you I hope that it

can affect you in the best sense of the

word what I'm about to speak I hope that

it is comprehend that well it is very

clear to me you already know that

whoever will understand will understand

if someone does not understand don't you

worry don't you worry don't you worry

don't exert yourself this must be

understood in a natural way when it is

explained to you one understands it if

you don't understand it then it is

because there is something in your being

that does not allow you to understand it

is simple and at the same time

Piper complicated and it goes absolutely

against what I've been teaching since

2008 that is rather strong what I'm

saying in other words what I'm about to

teach I'm gonna completely contradict

what I've been saying 2008 2009 2010

2011 2012 2013 2014 2015

I've already started to visualize this

and I start to give to you little by

little little by little because I

believe that you already understand what

I'm about to say you're an instant it

but you haven't completely noticed it

you have understood it you just haven't

noticed it completely so then little by

little the mind absorbs in order to get

to this understanding which is complete

and whole absolutely whole but of what I

have taught in the year 2008-2009 this

goes completely against it well last

Shabbat we studied Yahweh had part one

where we placed a base which always

should have been in our lives

permanently when Yahweh made me

comprehend this immediately he made me

understand many things which are about

to understand but the base of it all is

precisely the Shema and what is that

Shama say I imagine that up to now all

of you already memorized it I imagine

that when you got up in the morning you

repeated it before going to bed you

repeated it you've already started to

teach them to your children Shama Israel

yah will oh hey no Yahweh had here o

Israel Yahweh our Elohim Yahweh one is

many of you

and I'm not criticizing you but I am

instructing and teaching but not ready

to understand I'm gonna try to go slow

so that you assimilate everything that

I'm gonna teach many of you fell into

popping images of other of other places

of other sites from the Messianics the

Jews which don't use the name Yahweh the

yo hey valve Hey which are the four

consonants that compose the name of

Yahweh God hey love hey for the Jews

practicing of the Jewish religion which

is not the true one but the false one it

is a sin to mention that name it is

unutterable unutterable you cannot utter

it because the wise Jew said being us

we've falsely taken that name for so

long and every time we mention it it is

to say a curse or to ruin the truth from

now on we don't mention it again for it

is a mortal sin to utter it so then they

made up what is called certain titles

beginning with Hashem but what does

Hashem mean many of you started to put

up the Chimel like that

shameiess rail hashem aloha new hashem

echad and what does that mean well I'll

tell you what it means when you put up

Hashem Hashem means ha the Shem name

Hashem means the name whose name let's

start with that whose name the name of a

saw could it be could it be of course it

could be the name of Pope Benedict 17th

could not be it could it be the name of

hope friend says the first but blessed

be the name what is it every time you

say Hashem you give the opportunity of

blessing whomever is to say blessed be

blank space space space

fill-in-the-blanks dear leisure and the

ignorant Jews instead of mentioning who

is the name which has the salvation of

Israel they said the name blessed be the

name hallowed be the name of course in

Spanish you say well that sounds weird

right

but you instead of looking for the

information where you receive it you go

outside to look for it

Hashem and you fill your mouth with

energy I sure am blessed be Hashem what

the heck is has shimmed I don't know a

Shem is

Hashem is the name of my neighbor

blessed be the name of the dog of my

neighbors blessed be he for the name of

the dog is one yeah it is one southern

be zealous we are net practicing of the

Jewish Nordahl Christian religion

let's see if you finally understand that

we do not practice

neither the Jewish nor the Christian

religion let's see if you understand

that already we did not practice the

actual Jewish religion no the Christian

one so then we mentioned yah with the

way he wants to be mentioned Yahweh that

Hashem nor I deny Adan means Lord Adan

I don't need my Lord and I don't I the

Lord's I want you know that when you say

shameiess reign Yahweh no pardon me not

Yahweh I don't know el oh hey no I don't

I a hat I'll translate what it says hear

o Israel our Lord's our Elohim our

Lord's our one because at dawn I is not

neither Lord but our Lord's Adonai

comprehend that I'll repeat this once

again Adan means Lord I don't mr. son so

I don't know I don't she love I could be

I don't mr. Sherlock I don't he is my

lord

i don'ti my lord I don't I my lords

lords those are my Lords farewell then

so then every time you continue to look

for I mean who do you want to praise or

impress you look up quickly in the

Messianic sites where you shouldn't be

looking but if you want to look in the

Messianic websites go ahead and go with

the Messianics if you want to look in

the Jewish websites go with the Jews but

leave already but if I teach you Yahweh

it had you should not ever place Adonai

ehad nor ever Hashem I had instead

because both names are blasphemous what

I say let's see if you understand my

words which are in English and you

understand English I don't I we do not

use it leave that for the false

religions and Hashem even less have you

understood what Hashem is repeat after

me what is a Shem the name host name

here you may ever whatever my dog's name

in the name of a sizzle as well so then

when you say Hashem Hashem Hashem you

send the name the name and the name will

save me and we trust in the name because

the name will come to save us and I'll

baptize myself the name that's it

I'll get baptized in Hashem you are

saying stupid tease the stupidities

repaired by the wise Jews let's see if

now when you write things or you publish

things I am here to teach you I'm not

here to criticize you I am teaching you

you make a grave error every time you

want to publish things that I am NOT

teaching yahwah is a person has a name

in the Shema says Yahweh had it doesn't

say Hashem I had as I said tonight I had

it doesn't say God it had it does say

Jehovah had Jehovah's a little more

acceptable because Jehovah is a

transliteration of Yahweh

as a translation of Yahweh but whatever

other garbage you want to put up if you

like that go with those websites but

here our Elohim name is Yahweh it's not

Hashem

it is not denied his name is Yahweh and

we mention him because we actually love

him we don't love the name no leave the

name for the religions that do not have

understanding not the true understanding

they have religious understanding

nothing but religious understanding but

is it clear what I've taught is it very

clear ok how many times are you gonna

publish shame israel hashem ello hey new

I share my heart

ah sure so won't you should because I

would say that's a blasphemy because it

is written Yahweh the word Yahweh if I

change now when I place another I

changed them do you see precisely he

says don't place another I am Yahweh no

no no I don't want to mention Yahweh

because it is a sin who said that the

wise Jews what Jewish Wiseman the same

who did not accept you sure yeah the

same the very same they said that it is

a sin to say Yahweh let us say Hashem or

are denied our group of Lords I don't I

now they on the other hand saying that

years blasphemous wound exactly and they

for a Jew for a Jew and I'm talking to

someone from the Jewish religion because

I'm Jewish but they're false but a Jew

from the Jewish religion to hear me say

Yahweh had for them it is a blasphemy

because he's been trained that way and

all his Wiseman has said so and the

whole world has says so it is such a

blasphemy as if to tell Christian Paul

is a lime piece of garbage

he's blasphemous in thing say say what

they might just like the emoticon so

then it is clear Shaima Israel Yahweh

Elohim Yahweh a hat

exactly I had Ferelden

we have learned that the true worship is

a sexual act because Elohim says you are

mine all of you are mine and if you

worship another entity that is not me

you commit fornication fornication so

then you worship me the entire time

me and you will love me with all your

heart with all your mind and with all

your strength very well then

and the Shema also continues to say and

you shall love the away your Elohim with

all your heart with all your soul with

all your strength and these words that I

command thee today their commandment

will be on your heart and you will

repeat them unto your children and speak

to them on your home and when you're on

the way and when you go to bed and when

you get up in the morning and you will

tie them as a sign in your hand and

there will be as frontals in between

your eyes

and you will write them on your doorpost

and in your doors so then it is

something which our considers so

important because we won't understand a

thing if we don't have that clearly and

today we're about to understand

something strong just like that strong

but we can only understand it if this is

in our heart if this is just like yeah

that's nice it's a nice shimmer right

because the shamash is that Adonai is

our el hanout yeah I like the Shabbat

because it says that Hashem is our

Eloheinu you can understand this you can

understand it what we're about to study

you cannot understand Isaiah 45 14

through 15 I will review some of these

texts because we've got to understand

them not just Ashima elohim started to

define the Shama even more through his

prophets isaiah 45 14 through 15 this

banishment martini thou thus saith

Yahweh who says this the riches of Egypt

and the gains of Ethiopia and of the

sabaeans men of stature shall come over

to thee and they shall be thine they

shall come after thee in change they

shall come over and they shall fall down

unto thee they shall make supplication

unto thee surely in thee is Elohim only

V is home only the Israel is Elohim

Yahweh there is no one else there is no

other Elohim there's no one else there's

no other what there is neither Elohim

would you please hand me another pencil

this one is unsharpened thank you there

isn't I want you to remember this

because aside from the Shema this

Shabbat that schmuck could say yo is one

okay but after one there could be

another two and three for it could be

but the prophets later started to define

the concept here's Yahweh speaking and

he says there is no one else there is no

other Elohim period there isn't another

outside of Yahweh verily in thee there

is a hidden Elohim how's that Elohim the

elohim of israel the savior who is the

savior of Israel the only one there is

Yahweh there isn't another the only one

so then these words we've got to

understand them well or else we won't

understand what we're about to study

isaiah 45:17 through 25 and i'm still

reading from the martini Adam Israel has

been saved by Yahweh saved forever who

is the only savior of Israel the only

one Yahweh he shall not be ashamed nor

confounded world without end for thus

saith Yahweh that created the heavens in

other words the Creator who is Elohim

the only one that from the earth and

made it he that established that and

created it not empty but formed it to be

inhabited Oh Yahweh and there's no one

else

Oh Yahweh and there's no one else what's

he saying okay I want you to understand

something because if you don't

understand it because since 2008 we've

been saying the father and the son the

father the son next to this is blasphemy

do you understand

Yahweh says there is me and announced it

doesn't say my son and I you know say my

father and I I my grandson and my uncle

and my friend I am the anointed

I am the machine the machine and I no no

no no he says Iowa and there's no one

else

how many others are there are three

Yahweh no one else so then for Israel

which is chosen people which is his

bride

he's his eye and no one else is that

tear Israel I and no one else so then if

someone later on comes and says

something else what should we say

blasphemy

straight out blasphemy unless he's

telling us something else that we're not

understanding

very well then I have not spoken in

secret in a dark place of the earth

I said not unto the seed of Jacob which

is Israel see keep me in the void in

nothingness by Yahweh preach

righteousness and announced that which

is right gather together and assemble

yourselves and come survivors of the

nations they are foolish they that set

up the word of their graven image in

print Oh God

that cannot save speak expose your proof

deliberate one with another who have

declared this from ancient time has it

not been our Yahweh there is no other

Elohim outside of me

how many Elohim are outside of Yahweh

but what happens if Yahoo has a son

what happens if yahwah has a son what

happens there but what happens if yahwah

has a son and it's just like him how

many him would that be - but it is a

direct contradiction to what it's saying

here there is not another eloheem beside

me adjusting him and Savior there

doesn't exist someone else outside of me

just in case y'all wave marks it so many

times but so many times now he's just

said there doesn't exist anyone outside

of me now vio has a son after having

said this he has a son and then the son

of yahwah comes and he said i'm sent of

the father what should we tell the same

ladies false

at least that is false at least call him

false because yahweh the elohim of

israel says there doesn't exist anything

else beside me now if the sun comes who

claims to be the Son and he says I'm the

creator of everything right there too

tougher off changes no it doesn't change

on top of him saying that he's the

Creator everything he says is the son is

he what happens if we believe that he's

the son then he's even more of a liar

because we know that the one who created

everything is yahwah if the son of

yahwah comes and he says i created

everything but here it says that the

allah created everything no it's like i

created everything my dad didn't know

anything I did so then I mean who's the

bigger liar here it would seem as if it

were Yahoo because he said I did

everything and there isn't

I'm the savior of Israel by the way and

outside of me now there let him exists

no one else exists no one it is clear

what I'm guiding you through right okay

so then there are two possibilities left

two possibilities the first of which of

which many groups believe in this the

first of which is that the one who came

Yeshua HaMashiach

is not a la Haine of course he's not

eloheem if here there tell me that there

is neither Elohim then the one who came

will accept them as the Sun but that Sun

is not eloheem what he come for he came

to die for us and show us how to live

and bla bla bla but there is only one

father

however unto us there's only one Elohim

the father and one Lord Lord the word

curious so then we've got one Elohim and

one Korea's the Koreas is not eloheem

one Elohim the father and one coreos

those are curious I mean weeks at the

Manabi nestle he didn't come the Koreas

came and who's the courier's well it

claimed to be the son but he's not a

lame because he didn't know anything

about anything didn't even know the date

of when he was gonna return he's just so

ignorant as his I don't know anything I

speak only what I hear from the father I

mean that qu Deus is pretty pretty

ignorant he himself said so is that I

have no power of myself

everything I

do I do for the father he has no power

everything's done by the father he has

no knowledge of anything because he says

I what I speak is what I heard of the

father they're not my words other words

of the father

I learned it from my father so then he's

got no power he uses the father's power

doesn't know a thing

everything that he says is the word of

father and so then what he come here to

do it's just another prophet that's a

prophet the prophet has no power of

himself if the prophet doesn't in

miracles whose power is that yahwah's

that's how he's right

alleged work miracles was Elijah

powerful and himself no obviously not we

all understand that very well then now

that which is said by a prophet if it's

his words of himself he's a false

prophet the vicious words of Elohim he's

a prophet so then that's what I've got

that job was witnesses say yes yes Jesus

came but he's not alone because we're

witnesses of Jehovah they understand

that we're job as witnesses and

Jehovah's 1 alone and he says you cannot

have another limits out of me so then

how could it be that Jesus God Jesus

cannot be God they say ok not only do

they say that but also all the Adventist

groups the Adventist groups who don't

believe in the Trinity many of which

have come out of here and others formed

themselves and they worship the father

but they accept his son Yeshua they

accept him they accept them as the

Anointed One Anointed One

what's anointed well cause I love him

and I did him with more power than rest

he anointed him he is a great prophet he

is the prophet they say the greatest one

of them although there is the greatest

one what is yello him no no no there

can't be another eloheem because that

would break the Tanakh because vive the

father has been yahwah eloheem they then

also have the Sun as Elohim then I told

him and there's gonna come a point in

which I gotta say whom I'm gonna

the father of the son which of the two

there can't be two little Haim there

there's one but it's not by logic

because here it says I Yahweh there is

neither Elohim outside of me a righteous

elohim and savior now elohim outside of

me exists do you see when he elohim

could there be for a human being one how

many hours one so then the other

possibility parts in possibility which

they take away divinity from yeshua the

other possibility that's not a

possibility but the eternal truth star

possibility but the eternal truth Yahweh

was born on earth and he was born under

the name of Yeshua but he was Yahweh he

was not the godsend of Yahweh it was not

someone with the power of Yahweh

it was Yahweh Yahweh I am he said before

Abraham was I am and that I am is the

word in Heber to say precisely a name of

Elohim by which he revealed himself to

Moses in that way

who sent me I am I am sent me I am that

I am

southern you sure came to earth but

actually he was Yahweh he was not the

son of Yahweh he was Yahweh have it

understood that I'll continue reading is

that clear

I mean it can't get any clearer than

that it says I have sworn by myself the

word is gone out of my mouth a word

which is irrefutable said unto me every

knee shall bow unto Him unto Yahweh

every tongue shall swear by me by whom

by Yahweh saying only in Yahweh is there

salvation where is salvation in Yahweh

no one else it doesn't say Hashem here

doesn't say I deny here but in whom is

salvation in Yahweh and Yahweh unto him

not unto them unto Him shall man come a

saint all that are incensed against him

thanks to Yahweh all the race of Israel

the lineage of Israel shall obtain

justice and leap for Joey the only

justice that exists is through Yahweh

is not the son of Yahweh it's not a

godsend of Yahweh it is not of the

Messiah of Yahweh it is through Yahweh

period no one else we don't accept the

son of yahwah here we don't accept

yahwah's grandson we don't accept anyone

that is not Yahweh for it is prophesied

that the only one that has power to save

and the only one that will save and the

only one under which all knee shall bow

from the entire world is home Yahweh

absolutely Yahweh very well then but you

know we have a grave problem I'm about

to explain it we've got a grave problem

in what we believed from what I've

taught and from what you believe still

that is why these subjects we've got to

go step by step because you've already

accepted the Shabbat you've accepted

what I've said but you've still got a

whole lot of problems in your teaching

that must be corrected and will correct

them today Isaiah 46 8 through 13

I'll also be reading from the martini

though are we going back and forth

between versions as therefore 613

remember this and understand it well

come into reason ye sinners remember the

former things of old from Bereshit

that's the days of old that I am eloheem

and no other Elohim exists and there is

none like me how clear is that right

that is even more clear than I am all

right absolutely

from the beginning from Bereshit I

announced the end how did we learn

everything but the end from the

beginning that's where the end is that

is what we know that there are 12 years

left we know this from the beginning

it's where the end is 12 years and

everything ends unless y'all wait the

way I believe it initiates shebat arted

before time like when we stopped working

for Yahweh still works till today so

then it says declare at the end from the

beginning and from ancient times the

things that are not yet done saying my

decision is fulfilled I say my decision

is fulfilled in everything which pleases

me I also do it from the orient I called

the eagle

a far-off country the man which I have

designated just as I say I do it just as

I plan it I also do it hearken unto me

you stout hearted that are far from

righteousness I bring my righteousness

it shall not be far off and my salvation

shall not tarry and that will play

salvation in Zion and my glory for is

Rael for Oh miss y'all was glory for

Israel

Joel 227 joel 227 now I have a quick

question Christian your mind yes as one

of her counsel is well he's talking

about Cyrus but this prophecy by the man

of his counsel is referring to whomever

Brett his prophesy of many fulfillments

he's been talking about Cyrus that is in

sin Cyrus but it could also be that he

sent Nebuchadnezzar to destroy

everything when he says this is my man

that's the men that he will use to work

his will and so then it starts to be

applied in many cases and at the end it

has to be applied in d'lita obviously he

sends a man in order to make that which

has to be understood understood or for

that which has to be done to be done

albeit a punishment or instruction

whatever might be there Weldon so then

Hosea 13 for Spanish DHH yahwah says hi

yahweh i'm your elohim from the land of

egypt recognize not as elohim anyone

outside of me that is a command

recognize not if yahwah tells us that it

means that we could fall into the

temptation of recognizing as i love him

anyone else do you understand

the father for example for example

anyone else anyone else I'll beat the

father the son Graham at the ant the

mother the st. Paul so then it says he

says recognize not as eloheem anyone

outside of me say that way for only I

I'm your Savior that is nosy that could

mean he clear he's is V recognize

another let that other one save you but

you know where you're headed to the lake

of fire because the only one that can

save his I and my name is yahwah there

is neither did not recognize another and

even if another comes and says I am a

know him do not recognize him for

there's only one which is I Zachariah 14

nine we're talking about the future

we're talking on the new earth zechariah

14:9 tis and yahwah shall be king over

all the earth

in that day Yahweh shall be one how many

will they be in one his name that's it

if before he was one and now he tells us

you'll never have another Lehane but how

incongruent that at the end of times

therapy to write the father and the son

are incongruent and we came out of the

Trinity believing the father and the son

and we'll study many texts because you

still have him in your head about first

John second John he that does not have

the doctrine of the father and the son

don't even receive them in your house

you see there's a lot a lot they are to

the father in the Sun there too but here

says how many will there be always one

one Wow one

let us read a text a text which we've

read it some time ago but now it really

takes our greater importance in what I

am teaching

Deuteronomy for 27 through 40 this is

precisely two chapters before the Shema

Deuteronomy or Devarim for 27 through 40

enough shall read from the Spanish

Jerusalem two thousand one Yahweh shall

scatter you among the nations and ye

shall be left at few in number is that

true that that happened because y'all

was declaring it through Moses before he

even enters the promised land tell me if

y'all would does not have the capacity

of seen into the future Israel hadn't

even entered into the Promised Land

I entered there on the side the east

side of the Jordan

they haven't entered Moses is speaking

y'all was speaking through Moses and yah

was already telling him that he will

scatter them from the land they haven't

even stepped into land he's gonna scare

them he says and ye shall be left few in

number among the heathen whither yahwah

shall lead you and there you shall serve

gods or elohim the work of man sends

wood and stone which neither see nor

hear nor eat nor smell now was that all

fulfilled to the letter is what elohim

prophesize powerful fulfilled until

today we're in the midst of that

fulfillment but from Vence true

fulfillment true fulfillment but from

vents thou shalt seek you out with an

Elohim that is from exile and that shalt

find him if thou seek him with all thine

heart and with all thy soul so then it's

not that you saw some sign and all this

looks interesting no you're only gonna

see a sermon of the truth if you're

seeking the truth because you're sincere

that's if you're seeking the truth and

if you're sincere if you're seeking for

the truth because if you're not looking

for the truth the truth will not look

for you with our Christian mind we want

to put signs up all over the place to

announce with a speaker and to cry out

loud Jesus loves you Jesus loves you

Jesus forgives all that you've done but

please come and give us your tithes and

offering in this church that is what

they're looking for so then he says that

from thence he shall seek Yahweh and ye

shall find him if you seek him with all

thine heart and bull's eye so when the

arts in tribulation and all these things

are come upon thee even in the latter

days the Express

Sunday is that in the latter days of the

earth at the end southern Israel has not

even entered Canaan and y'all was

already prophesying what's gonna happen

in the latter days not then but in the

latter days so then that prophesy gets

directly to us at the end of times if

they turn onto Yahweh dine eloheem and

shalt be obedient unto his voice he says

that barely at the end of time with the

people of Israel turn unto Yahweh talk

about remnant Iraq exactly the few that

are left for Yahweh thy Elohim is a

merciful Elohim he will not forsake thee

neither destroy thee nor forget the

Covenant of thy fathers which he sware

unto them for ask ask now the days that

are passed which are before thee since

the days that eloheem created man upon

the earth has there ever been from one

end of the heavens and to another even a

greater things than this or hath been

heard like it that ever a people hear as

thou has heard the voice of Elohim live

speaking out of the midst of the fire

and hath survived or had any Elohim s

aid or some God or some Elohim so that

just to get you understand I've ever SAT

to go and to take him a nation from the

midst of another nation in other words

Israel the myths of Egypt a nation from

the midst of another by means of trials

signs wonders in war by mighty hand and

by a stretched arm and by great terrors

according to all that Yahweh your Elohim

did for you before your very eyes in

Egypt unto thee it has been given to see

all this woe what privilege that thou

mightest know that Yahweh is Elohim and

there is none

beside him understand that yahwah says

and you understand that when does he say

at the end of times at the end of times

and what we're gonna understand that

yahwah eloheem and what else and that

there is none beside him out of heaven

he made thee to hear his voice that he

might instruct thee and upon earth

he showed thee his great fire and thou

heardest his words out of the mists of

fire for he loved thy father's and he

chose their seed after them and brought

thee out of Egypt personally with his

great mighty power he drove out the

nation's before thee greater and

mightier than thou to bring the end to

give thee their land for an inheritance

as it is this day recognized

therefore this day and meditate in your

heart recognize today at the end of

times today is 2nd of Sivan of the Year

5980 7 the 16th of June of the year 2018

yahwah tells each and every one of us

personally recognize therefore this day

and meditate in your heart that Yahweh

is Elohim there in heaven above and here

on earth beneath and there is none else

well how clear is that right is that

clear there

he says Yahweh is the Elohim up there in

heaven and down here on earth and there

is none else keep therefore his statutes

and his commandments which I command

thee this day that it may go well with

thee and with thy children after thee in

the dummest prolonged thy days upon the

earth which are within eloheem give it

thee for ever and now let us go to

deuteronomy 32 deuteronomy 32:39 through

43 39 through 43

right from the Jerusalem 2001 see now

that I am I

how many can there be there i am i he

says he doesn't say we are one we are we

would you say I am i Wow

and there's no other Elohim next to be

hold on a minute he's like what else

does he say next to me there is not

other Elohim and I'm not reading this

from Paul mind you where am i reading

this from from the Torah there might

even the trough in who's speaking here

who's this I am i it's not Moses sane

look he is he

look Hashem is Hashem as the ignorant

would say look I don't I as I don't I

no no no he's directly speaking look I

am I and there's no other Elohim next to

me I kill and I make alive

what's he say I kill and I make alive I

wound and I healed neither is there any

that can deliver out of my hand no one

there isn't I kill when a person does

whoever might be what you always say

they already prophesied will you say a

cause to die and what else to say I make

alive I won't

and a heal I make the wound and I heal

it as well neither is there any that can

deliver out of my hand can anyone free

himself from sent so then the question

is who inserted or by whose work is

there in this scriptures so many laws

Yahweh who raised Paul that he may

preach all that garbage yeah we did so

then when we blame a giselle

I mean who gave aces of the power to

play with the languages yahwah did but

in the end of it or who was playing with

aces of yahwah was

if Yahweh would not have wanted for the

language to be touched could Isis will

have touched it so then why did he give

him power why did he give him that power

to his o for him to touch it okay verbal

them yes I lift up my hand to heaven and

say sure is that I live eternally

what does always say that he lives

eternally when I sharpened the edge of

my sword and mine hen take hold on

judgment I will render vengeance to mine

enemies and will reward them that hate

me I will make my arrows drunk with

blood and my sword shall devour flesh

blood of the slain and of the captives

as well as crowned heads of the enemies

heavens exalt with him and worship Him

the children of Elohim I'll claim him

nations along with his people and all

the messengers of Allah heem narrate his

strength for he shall avenge the blood

of his servants and take vengeance on

his adversaries

he'll repaid those who hate him and will

cleanse the land of his people

astonishing directly from Elohim he says

I am I and there is no other living with

me so then where does that leave the

Trinity saying that there are three

different people where's that left

where's that turning left in the lake of

fire Matthew 22 29 and I skipped a whole

bunch of texts which will leave forever

for this subject opens up actually it's

been two years that or maybe a little

longer I've been planning to present the

Godhead once I preached against Paul I

said I said mind you I said

I said I'm gonna give the Godhead and I

prepared myself to give the Godhead and

I even got encouraged to write book in

other words only in my thoughts I wanted

to present the Godhead again I even had

the title and everything of the Godhead

and every time I would start to initiate

my guide I just couldn't do it I

couldn't do it I understand why because

all I would have explained was the

father and the son who are two and not

three not three not one but two so then

all I was really gonna explain with

luxury of details without paul with

Arlen without anything the same thing I

explained in 2008 that they are - that

the father sent the son and we honor and

worshipped the Son and the father when

we go to heaven will be thanking the

father and the son and to God who's in

the throne as it says the revelation and

the lamb those are two where's the third

one where's the third one there -

everywhere we see the worship is for two

- two weren't going anywhere with too

often the like fire and like well

actually we weren't going to like fire

because it is all a plan of yahwah's a

pan of yahwah's and he makes us

understand things step by step all those

that left apostates occur said all those

has left every last one of them do you

know what they preached what they

learned

- that they are - that is what they

preached do you think they're gonna be

moved from that they said I don't accept

that prophet but I preached the truth

they say the truth what truth that of

the father and the son and they continue

with the truth of the father and son

they add there are little there are

little points of view and all the rest

but they left with the Godhead of the

father and son and today 2018 I am

deleting the truth about the father and

the son how many are there there's one

there's only one exactly but I'm

referring to within my preaching because

you sure came to delete it from us

exactly exactly

issuer made me understand in the

adequate time what I understood

time ago some time ago understood this

just as I understood the bride of Yeshua

and everything else that I've been

explaining that is because the time of

his return is soon drawing nigh because

those whom he's gonna take as a hundred

and forty-four thousand says that they

follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth

they don't follow the father there's an

ally in their mouth they clearly

understand what they believe because if

he came to look for us in 2011 we were

like eh where's the father and the son

we want to see the father and the son

the throne has two seats I said shows

the father imagined that the sons gonna

be there will gamble again but where's

the father

but I digress from what I wanted to say

Matthew 20 to 29 says then you sure

answered and said unto them ye do error

you do her woman she tone that the

Pharisees the scribes the interpreters

of the law ye do herb cream and crop of

Israel exactly he do her and how do

these blokes earth not knowing the

Scriptures nor the power of Elohim two

things why can we also herb tell me why

why because we ignore the scriptures and

we know not the power of Elohim we just

don't know it

so then if we came out of worship and

three and worshiping two because they

were three clearly three and he said

this Holy Spirit belongs to this one

these two are one actually we have two

we left the to take this one up we have

two and I'm saying wait this guy's this

guy well we're left into three are one

you're still with me right absolutely

okay you're still with me because at

this point I'm why did we uh okay now

with all the texts that are read to you

from the Tanakh the Shamal is it not

clear that how many are there there one

so then how could we add that they are

two why because we ignore the Tanakh if

since we were low we would have learned

that it's 1 1 1 1 1 we would never have

said it's 2 2 2 2 2 and much less that

they are 3 3 3 3 3 okay and there's also

one other thing which we are the power

of Elohim in John 14 you sure says we've

already studied it but we'll review it

because we're gonna read John 15 just

let your heart not be troubled you

believe in Elohim you believe in losing

a lot him you believe in Yahweh believe

also me

why gives it the same person there is

another possibility if I believe in

Yahweh and Yahweh said there is no one

else beside me when someone says this is

my father

it is I because otherwise I'd become

false the only one that can come and

save and redeem is who yahwah that is

why you sure says you believe in Yahweh

you believe everything that y'all said

did you study the prophets well what

they said okay then believe in me as

well

why believe in me as well because I am

Yahweh period there isn't any other

possibility out there he says I am the

way the truth and the life no one comes

into Yahweh the father if not by me

because from the time in which I came

here no one can understand Yahweh if he

does not accept me do you know why

because I am Yahweh says Yeshua it is

absolutely clear but he's saying it in

parables if he knew me and understood

what he's saying you would also know my

father why if I understand that that

person is is Yahweh I would know Yahweh

the father but being as I see him as

another person as the son of Yahweh I

cannot see Yahweh because i have Amazon

o a God send the Prophet another

another I can't see the father so then

Yeshua says if he knew me you would also

know my father and from now once you

understand this he know him and ye have

seen him not only he know him by word

but what else you have seen him and they

were looking at was home that is a

direct declaration ye have seen Yahweh

if he understand that I am Yahweh Philip

just like all of us who don't understand

says tells him something he tells him

lord kurios kurios that was not eloheem

coreos show was the father and it's

enough for us show us you sure says but

you're looking at him and then like show

is the father that's enough for us it

sure told him so much time that i've

been with you and ye have not known me

Philip

he that hath seen me hath seen the

father how then say us now show us the

father he's been more than clear he

didn't speak in parables there he didn't

use parables but that no that's weird

did they understand that had we

understood no of course we hadn't

understood very well then it says it

continue to say believe not that I am in

the father and the father and me believe

not that I am the father the words that

I speak I don't speak him out of my own

account but the father who dwells in me

does the works the flesh that you're

looking at that you think it's a human

being he says he's not talking to you

the one who's talking to you is the

father who dwells in me the father that

you're not seeing Yahweh who lives in me

that is what he's saying

Yahweh lives in me what you see is a

human being which you called the Son of

Man the Son of man that son of man that

you're looking at he's not speaking to

you he's just a shell who's speaking to

you Yahweh who dwells

in me he does the works don't think that

this human being does the things who

does them Yahweh does the things it's as

if well my example sunsets aren't all

that great but if we see that other

sudden I well that I let's say Yahweh it

comes and takes my spirit because I

don't have any power and places it on my

dog and that dog speaks to you and all

that

what would the dog say don't believe

that I am speaking but it is the spirit

that dwells in me can the dog speak no

what could a dog speak because it's

paired twelves in him yes or no so then

the dog does not speak to you even if

you hear the dog speak the dogs aren't

speaking to you is that clear the dog

does not have the possibility of

speaking because the dog does not think

but if they put me or you into a dog how

how do you think that dog could speak I

give you all study here like a dog and

you would say what a smart dog no the

dogs not doing anything but they're

spared the twelves and the dog are you

understanding that that is what you

should saying that is what issue is

saying he says verily verily I say unto

you he that believeth in me the worst

that I do he shall also do them and even

greater than these he shall do for I go

to the Father again I'll be the father I

skipped eleventh believe me that I am in

the father 11 and the father in me or

else believe me through the very works

there you have it it is very clear all

the works done by Yeshua which the SDA

and I want you I would say that he did

everything through the power of the

Father but that you sure did not use his

power you've heard that right the whole

time that's how I was taught

I was doctrine iced like that you should

never used his power he sure came like a

human being completely powerless and he

had to be asking for everything from his

father and the Holy Spirit would come

the third person and he would do the

works you should say and believe me that

I am the father because of the works I'm

doing because there's no human being

that has ever done my works

what great

is there in me doing works tell me does

that make me an Elohim no but it says

that Allah him is using me but he came

here to be alone him not to be used by

Lehane I was why did he come he could

have used anyone there are you following

and whatsoever ye shall ask of the

Father in my name I shall do that the

father be glorified in the son obviously

whatsoever you shall ask of the father

because Yeshua never I mean it would

have been an attempt against his own law

to remove Yahweh Yahweh is the only

Elohim are you following that Yahweh

came to a group of Israelites who

believed in the Tanakh when they say

hashem well that's now but when they

would say Elohim whom the word they're

referring to Yahweh the Israelites of

that time and now as well at that time

do they have another him whose name is

not Yahweh no yah was the only Elohim

okay so then if he sure comes every time

he says my father his father whom is he

referring to Yahweh you do follow that

right okay then and if you're following

that you sure didn't come to have Yahoo

removed he didn't come to replace Yahweh

he came so as to have Yahweh who is he

died for his wife and that they

understand the thing is that's way says

whatsoever you shall ask of the father

who's the father Yahweh whatsoever you

shall ask of the Father in my name you

see the combination it is no longer

valid once he came in a different figure

it was no longer valid for me to

continue asking of Yahweh it wasn't Aled

it made no sense to ask Yahweh when

yahwah came in person did you understand

that decomp rended yahwah comes with a

different name but he's Yahweh what

sense does it make for another group to

stay praying to Yahweh no we don't

accept you but he's Yahweh we only want

Yahweh so then that's why he says when

you pray pray to Yahweh who is I Yahweh

what you have learned since you were low

that which is written but in my name

when they prayed to Yahweh in his name

means is that we accept and understand

that Yeshua is Yahweh we combine the two

names there we parent to Yahweh in the

name of Yeshua why in the name of Yeshua

cuz yahwah came in the name of yeshua if

i well I could pray unto Yahweh in the

name of Yahweh cuz yahwah knows that I

use indiscriminately both names because

for me it is the fusion of the two names

assure Yahweh do you understand that but

he is teaching them you it is no longer

valid to ask of me our way if you don't

ask in my name it's no longer valid

there is no power in anything I ask you

our way your Elohim but in my name what

he's saying except that I came in that I

am Yahweh and now you ask it under my a

new name is what I said understood

clearly very well then he says that the

father who's Yahweh be glorified in the

son that Yahweh the father be glorified

in home in the son memo for now continue

to understand it that way the Son of Man

with our soever ye shall ask in my name

I will do it for he is Yahweh if you let

me keep my Commandments and I shall pray

unto the father and he shall give you

another comforter that he be with you

for ever here I clearly explained it

that there's another comforter outside

of Yahweh the following text that at

read Isaiah 51 Isaiah 51 12 15 and 22 I

read again Isaiah 51 12 through 15 and

22

it reads as follows I how many people is

I I i am your comforter who is the

comforter yahweh the holy spirit know

that i write the holy spirit but it is

clear that it is the holy spirit but

here is someone speaking saying i whose

are the holy spirit no aah

Yahweh same thing even I am he that

comforted thee who art thou that thou

shouldn't be afraid of men that shall

die in the son of men which shall be

made us grass and forget us Jia way thy

maker Yahweh is our comforter Yahweh is

our maker and had stretched forth the

heavens and laid the foundations of the

earth and has feared continually every

day because of the fury of the oppressor

as if he were ready to destroy and where

is the fury of the oppressor the captive

exile haste myth that he may be loosed

and I'll tell you what we actually feel

like captives here and that he should

not die in the pit nor that his bread

should fail for Yahweh that divided the

sea whose waves roared thine Elohim

whose name is Yahweh set out or Yahweh

of hosts translated so the gnarley'

hymns name is Yahweh set out 22 thus

saith Yahweh thy Lord when done Elohim

who advocates the cause of his people

what is he the advocate for his people

but an advocate not as someone's defense

it's the one that handles all the legal

issues it's not that as you implied in

to the Father first people mind you

behold I have taken out of thine hand

that's why is the Advocate behold I have

taken out of thine hand the cup that

Stannis

we've been stunned to this very day tell

you what I'll tell you wait up until

today or maybe even a couple subjects

back we were stunned with the doctrine

of

- that is what's got to be stunned and

yahwah tells us I have taken out behold

I have taken out of thine hand the cup

that stun ahthe even the dregs of the

cup of my theory thou shalt no more

drink it again once you understand will

understand you no longer drink that and

if we no longer drink that the neither

is the fury of Yahweh gonna reach us

where well we go back to the 14 which is

where's this I shall pray to the Father

and he shall give you another comforter

another way of comforting we are not

that the only comforters home Yahweh

that he'd be with you forever

this part of Truth whom the world cannot

receive for they do not see him nor know

him but you know him and again he tells

them you know the counselor for he

dwelleth with you

he says the comforter is dwelling now

with you but he will be in within you so

then you're sure repeats therefore

mother will understand this parable that

the counselor is he that the father is

he I shall not leave you as orphans I

shall come unto you what did you she

says I will come unto you it is more

than clear absolutely clear who is the

comforter Yeshua Yahweh he is sure the

same thing ya little while the world

will not see me anymore but you shall

see me for I live ye shall also live and

on that day ye shall know on that day ye

shall know that I am in my father what

we're gonna know is that he is the

father in ye and me and I in you he that

hath my Commandments and keepeth them he

is the one that loveth me and he shall

be loved of my father and I shall love

him and shall manifest myself unto Him

my father is Yahweh what he's saying

here which I've already explained but

I'm just reviewing forgotten to the next

chapter he that loveth me shall be loved

by Yahweh he died love with the asure

shall be left by Yahweh you see what

he's saying are you following he died

love with me was he that loveth me yeah

sure he that loveth me shall be loved by

our way and I shall love him yeah I will

obviously it's a manifest myself up to

him the one that's gonna manifest myself

is the only one that's

manifest himself and then Judas told

them not Iscariot Lord how will ye

manifest yourself unto us obviously he

didn't understand that he was gonna

manifest himself and another you sure

answered and said he that loveth me my

word he shall keep and my father shall

love him

in other words Yahweh shall love him and

we shall come into him and we shall blob

with him obviously if Yahweh in Yeshua

come only one person comes up obviously

we understand that right clearly very

well then

24 it says he that loveth me not keep it

not my Saints that's over it's not an

obligation really not at all and the

word which he hear is not mine but the

fathers which set me in other words

whose word is that whose law is that the

father who sent him whose Yahweh he's

referring to it's raw and to you have I

spoken these things while yet with you

but the comforter whom we already said

was he the Holy Spirit whom we already

said it was he whom the father shall

send whom Yahweh's sends in my name

obviously because it's all about him he

shall teach you all things and bring all

things to your remembrance whatsoever I

said unto you peace I leave with you my

peace are given to you not as the world

giveth give I unto you let your heart

not be troubled neither let it be afraid

you have heard I said unto you I go away

and come again unto you if you loved me

you would rejoice because I said I gone

to the father for my father is greater

than I obviously yahwah is greater than

Yeshua for what reason is Yahweh greater

than your sure now right now forget

about the father of Yeshua right here

the father of Yahweh is out of the

equation

why is yahwah greater than Yeshua for

you Shore is enclosed in a body of flesh

obviously it's obvious if they put me

into a chihuahua dog and they're a play

a match of tennis with Armando our

mothers gonna beat me this time even if

I am the one that plays with with the

body of a chihuahua it's gonna beat me

even if it is I so true are you gonna

hold the racket and you see we start

with that exactly starting with that

whether it smelt well you see I'll bet

you'll beat them either way but none all

the techniques okay if I am

turned into a shawarma dog knowing all

the techniques of tennis and love that

what good is it

I can't apply them that's why it says

that's why you should says if the spirit

of you I was with you'll beat him the

spirit the issue says try to comprehend

what you should saying it's just as the

father is greater than I obviously he

came enclosed in a body limited in a

body and he could not do everything that

he could have done yes or no obviously

so then that's why it says the father is

greater than I but he's not talking

about his father from where he was born

I think I said that last time but as we

go on to present today this subject I

had to once again read the entire

so-called New Testament taking out Paul

of course cuz he's no good

I had to once again read everything

because in order to give you a subject

I've had to understand everything in the

only way of understanding thing is to

have everything present at the time I

had to read everything again once again

everything all of it end many parts of

the old of what the tonight because I

like to read a lot because I cannot get

to this understanding if I don't have

all the prophets present at the same

time your understanding right well so it

cannot be understood because if I study

if I start just a little bit it is no

good I have to study at all because not

to present the subject to study

everything once again that is clear that

the more I study the more I understand

things and I believe that in the last

subject and remember I explained that

Yahweh that you should saying that the

father who began him is greater than he

okö he's greater but he's not talking

about that father I'll repeat Yahweh has

a father why does he have a father is it

revealed here not it was never revealed

only in Bereshit it is found what I say

it is only embellished sheep in the

creation of men the rest the father

never appears listen to my words

because I've already told you that every

time I understand this subject even

better every time father is mentioned it

is Yahweh every time they say the son of

man or the son of Elohim it is Yeshua

when you stress is my father

it is not the father of Yahweh it is

Yahweh but just always in every case

don't argue

be you're not here to argue I also have

to do what that pastor Anderson did

alright I've seen that where he kicked

up some folk don't argue because that

goes against I know that didn't I tell

you that this was gonna be an attempt

against your beliefs so then just go

with it don't argue in all of Scripture

it does not mention the father of Yahweh

it is Yahweh only it is only a better

sheet where we get a glimpse that yahwah

has mother and father we catch a glimpse

clearly but that does not mean that

later continues to unfold the story of

the father and the mother of Yahweh no

yo is only one yah was alone there is

not another with him he explains it so

that you never get confused

so then yahwah when he comes as Yeshua

is the son of men he had never been that

the son of men he's the son of men when

he says my father or the father or his

father referring to Elohim he's talking

about Yahweh who is he never the father

of Yahweh never never I mean are you

understanding my words okay cuz I want

because then later I tell you the Shema

and you change it for our Shemin

understand my words I'm gonna say it for

the third time let's see so that your

spirit can comprehend as well yahwah the

eloheem of israel the creator of the

world the creator of the human race has

a father and possibly even a mother but

i could care less about that you clearly

see that in better seed when once yahweh

started to write his Torah in his

scriptures every time he says Yahweh

Elohim is he Yahweh he says I am alone

understand this I am alone there is not

know him with me this is my creation

there is no one to help me to create he

says it clearly in all the text

I'm the only savior of Israel and you'll

never know another eloheem outside of me

for you

not another Elahi me exists except for

Yahweh that is clear right

when yahwah comes and he's born in the

form of yeshua which he already

prophesied that he was gonna do it was

hidden obviously Yeshua came he made

assembly called the Son of Man why the

Son of Man for what reason cuz he was

born of men yes or no before yo it was

not the son of men man was the son of

Yahweh always man is the son of Yahweh

but came the father of humanity the

father of Israel and inserted himself in

Israel he became the son of Israel the

sunnis of yahweh pay attention when

Yahweh made himself a son he became the

Son of Man and of Elohim as well because

there's one solo him so then yeah we had

two options either to say I am Elohim

Yahweh and do everything as if he were

Yahweh but what acceptation would he

have had not even from us look not even

from us because nothing would even have

been written about him because no one

would have accepted anything

what do you mean Uriel and then they

killed yawen who left without Yahweh are

you following this on the other hand

when yahwah came being as he did things

perfectly we don't even have to think

why he did things like that i would have

done better yahweh cut himself into the

human race he was born of human beings

may be said we called the son of men as

well as the son of Elohim he was not the

son of man nor the son of Elohim

it was Yahweh he was not the son of man

because he's not born of man are you

following because if I say the son of

man then he was always a man no no he

said before Abraham I am and he says I'm

the lehem that descended from heaven so

then the son of man is just a name why

because he took him in flesh he took him

in flesh but I'm taking human flesh and

making himself son man

immediately also became what Sanibel

ahem are you following or am I am I in

becoming the sons of man he also became

the son of Elohim because because Yahweh

cannot call himself the Son of man just

abandoned yahwah said of man how does

that sound

think about it

Yahweh the son of men no Yahweh will

never be the son of men you sure's

listen up men

that's why take another name are you

following so then when he speaks when he

speaks about himself as he is really

he says Yahweh his father my father

Elohim is he when he speaks about

himself this I I but you've seen here I

don't know a thing

all I speak is what I received of the

father what's he talking about there

he's talking within a parable that

everything that he says yahwah says it

for he is Yahweh what you're looking at

is the son of men but that son of men

really is not a human being it is Yahweh

that human being that you're seeing that

they were seeing

he doesn't say I think has done no thing

in fact that shells gonna be thrown out

he is Yahweh is what I'm saying being

comprehended ok very well then so then

Yeshua says on what text did I leave off

ah the comforter ok very well the father

is greater than I now I understand he as

the sin of men

how can he speak of himself as Yahweh

he's greater a lot greater farewell 29

and now I have told you before it come

to pass that when it come to pass you

might believe hereafter I will not talk

much with you for the prince of this

world cometh and have nothing to me he

had no power me but that the world may

know that I love Yahweh that father is

Yahweh but that the world may know that

I love Yahweh and as the father Yahweh

gave me commandment even so I do arise

let us go hence I'm about to explain

this text a little more and what's

coming up next

let us go to John 15 but yeah Matthew

well there's something on mature instant

all of John all of John 13 John 13 which

we didn't read okay John 13 14 15 16 and

17 13 14 15 16 and 17

do you know when Yeshua spoke those

words the night of the last saidar

then that of Pesa immediately after that

he went to the mountain he was arrested

okay so then this topic is explained but

the comforter that he was leaving is

gonna return the father's guard night

he's explaining it the last day that

he's gonna be with this disciple that is

very important to understand that this

he explained at the end that's why they

were so desperate shows the father but

wait a minute I'm the father are you not

seeing me here very well then

that is exactly what I wanted to show

understand that it is the message of the

cedar of pestle

let's go to chapter 15 but before

chapter 15 before chapter 15 I've got to

read to you a text from chapter 16 which

we won't study today because we won't

have time today to steady 16 while only

city 15 but I've got to read to you

something so that your mind gets some

sort of rest because I can be saying a

lot what I believe from what I

understand but in your mind it's still

the father and the son resounding follow

the son he that hath not the father hath

not the son he that he denies the son

has not the father

I know that he's saying maybe in your

mind still there's some doubts I know

that in your mind you will understand it

slow by little just to get you haven't

understood it yet you will comprehend

and love this when you comprehend well

the Shema once you understand the Shema

this will forcefully fall into place if

you have not the shim on your heart

you still have two or maybe even three

complete idol worshipers right but once

you have the shimmer in your heart no

matter what is written

you will comprehend it whether it's true

what was said you will comprehend it as

a parable are you a nurse Templar said

well then so then I will read but I want

to read to you before we won't study it

John 16 that is but I want to read this

to which you're like John 16:25 write

that text down you should even memorize

it almost at the end of his discourse

issue says the following John 16:25

these things have I spoken unto you in

Proverbs you should after everything he

said John 13 14 15 16

what does Yeshua say these things have I

spoken unto you in Proverbs which is

parables but the time cometh when I

shall no more speaking to you in

Proverbs in parables or stories but I

shall show you plainly of the father

Wow you sure set these words but where

is it written what he clearly said about

the father John 15 no never ever he's

referring to now now you're

understanding what the father is that

the father is he pause look where he

clearly said some but father he never

clarified anything but he says the time

will come the New Living Translation

says John 16:25 dealing translation I

have spoken of these matters in figures

of speech everything I've been reading

but father and son what did you say

so the nothing was literal the way he

said it DM senders after having spoken

about the Holy Spirit and all that he

says I've spoken these matters in

figures of speech but sooner we'll stop

speaking figuratively and we'll tell you

plainly all about the father

so then what he'd spoke but the father

he didn't speak

clearly do you follow Wow

the Spanish DHH same text so that you

memorize it and comprehend that it is

all a parable I have told you these

things given you comparisons of course

the Father Son the Holy Spirit their

comparisons but the hour cometh in which

I will no longer give you comparisons

but I will clearly speak to you about

the father in the last version Jerusalem

2001 Jerusalem 2001 I have told you

everything how many things that he tell

him everything in parables oh I love

this version that says I've told you

everything in parables but all this is

John 13 14 15 and we're now in 16 the

entire message of the father and the son

I did you should say it so then why do

we want it literally my father greater

than nice he my father sent the son my

father days my father did that my father

he says well I want you to know that I

have told you all these things in

parables the hour cometh in which I will

no longer speak to you in parables but

with all clarity will I speak to you

about the father and today I'm speaking

to you about the father the father is

issue HaMashiach the father is yahwah it

is only one person and there is not two

for us

never again one alone he always was and

he always will be one alone that is what

it calls about the father and everything

that you should have said that the

father is Yahweh the son is you sure

it's the same person in our letters do

go to John 15 let's do go to John 15 I

am the vine and my father is the husband

and we just started it I am the vine and

my father is the husbandman so then who

planted the vine there the father the

husband then who plants the vines is the

vine plant itself there husband man

who's the husband Yahweh so then who was

the vine you sure you noticed the same

person but before we'd see to there

that's why I'm telling you once I start

to speak about this

speak and to explain the parable it all

changes cuz no matter how much you

believe this Shamala

when I take you to a chapter in the

Bible you're not ready to read you still

see - he says I am The True Vine and my

father is the husbandman he's talking

about himself he is the vine is born on

earth where's the van born on earth but

who placed it on earth

the father the father is he he is born

as the vine he is the same person is

that clear is that understood or sure

repeat this 20 times over is it very

clear father Yahweh son Yeshua the same

person every branch in me that beareth

NOT fruit say if he is sure he taketh

away who will take it away the father

the father said wait there's an

interaction between the two we have not

two eloheem if you understand this if

you misunderstand it like up until today

how many divine people have we there -

one is the van the other ones the father

if I'm not in the van the father comes

next me away something right we worship

to know that father and son same person

every branch in me that beareth NOT

fruit he taketh away and every branch

that bears fruit he purchased it then it

may bring forth more fruit the branches

are weak obviously now you are clean say

Athiya sure what through the word which

I have spoken unto you now ye are clean

cleansed by whom by the fire hope does

he say that cleanses the father and who

cleansed up there he himself says it by

the word which I spoken to you okay he

said I'm the vine my father is the

husband and he says he that is not at me

the father comes and takes him away or

purchase it that it bear more fruit

now the Susan G show says you're clean

by the word I spoken to you right there

he clearly says I'm the vine and the

husbandmen

are you following okay very well then if

you understand this will continue abide

in me and I in you me him we obviously

it is us so then he says there's one so

being that can remain in you it is I

as the branch cannot bear fruit of

itself except it abide in the vine the

vine is Yeshua no more can ye except ye

abide in me in Yeshua I am the vine ye

are the branches he that abideth in me

and I in him the same bringeth forth

much fruit for without me ye can do

nothing it is very clear you should

declare some South Elohim right there

why does he says you have to be

worshipping me stuck to me if I am NOT

eloheem are you gonna be worshipping me

if the life depends on me as it says it

absolutely depends on me right there he

did claim self to be Yahweh Elohim

Yahweh I had six if a man abide not in

me he is cast forth as a branch and is

withered and men gather them and cast

them into the fire and they are burned

if ye abide in me and my words abide in

you ye shall ask what ye will and it

shall be done unto you herein is my

father glorified that is Yahweh herein

is Yahweh glorified that ye bear much

fruit so shall ye be my disciples as the

father hath loved me so have I loved you

continue ye in my love exactly this text

I loved I'm about to explain it to you

look at what it says because it would

seem as if it were a person if you

understand what I've explained to you

that the father is Yahweh and yahwah's

Yeshua and it's the same person

how does issue say as the father hath

loved me so have I loved you continue in

my love for it's a commandment the

commandment is here and I'll go ahead

and renew you shoes version whose quote

on the Tanakh anyway but a garden read

it this even tells us is Matthew 22:37

2:40 I'll explain it to you Matthew

22:37 2:40

reads as follows Yeshua said unto them

thou shalt love Yahweh thy Elohim with

all thine heart and with all thy soul

and with all thy mind and with all your

strength as it should say they're not on

your mind you've already got your heart

soul and strength this is the first and

Great Commandment and the second is like

unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor

which is your lineage thou shalt love

thy lineage as thyself so then is there

a problem with loving oneself if you

don't love yourself you do not deserve

to live eternally

just like that I'll tell you like that

let's see if let's see if I'm clear

enough in what I say if we do not love

ourselves we could never love Elohim not

even our lineage we just can't for the

commandments clearly says love thy

neighbor as thyself so then if I hate

myself then I can hate my neighbor I can

hate him cuz I don't love me I don't

love anybody and we're all good I

fulfilled that commandment no no that's

not it the thing is that to love

ourselves means to look for what's best

for us always physically for our soul

for our for our spirit to look for the

best spiritual food look for eloheem to

look for Allah hammy's to love ourselves

it is still of life if you don't love

life why are you gonna be looking for a

lane and if that guarantees you death

but yeshu says that you should love thy

lineage as much as myself there's no

problem loving oneself but you should

love your lineage at the same level as

thyself

see that's the secret you cannot love

thyself more than your lineage are you

following that and much less more than

something Elohim so then Yeshua says was

that understood so we can move on

farewell then out of these two

Commandments

hang all the law and the prophets as

Yeshua what commandment to love Yahweh

and to love your neighbor your lineage

as thyself so then what's it saying this

commandment actually to love Yahweh to

love myself and to love thy neighbor

those three are you following it's three

but they're related to love thy neighbor

as thyself you have to love myself love

thy neighbor love Elohim ever I'll go

back to what LM says as the father hath

loved me he's talking my love in himself

I don't him as to love himself they

didn't love himself he would not have

traded no earth for himself are you

following

of course eloheem loves himself what is

he exactly saying here he says I have

I'm gonna turn it around cuz it's a

parable I'm gonna invert it instead of

saying as the father had loved me so

have I loved you you sure says I have

loved you as much as myself that's what

he's saying how it changes doesn't it

that is what the commandment says he

says love thy neighbor as thyself

you should says Yahweh has loved me so

much just like I love you turn that

around and you should sing in a parable

I love you as much as I love myself and

there are there's tremendous because it

makes no sense for a father let's go

ahead and speak it in the previous way

we understood it that our father loves

the son and because the father loves

that son he loves us what does that have

to do with anything tell me what does

that have to do with anything

nothing just like the father has left me

I love you now since the father has

loved me I love him in any case the

father but he says as the father has

loved me I love you

it has nothing to with the fact well you

sure same as the father had loved me as

much as I love myself so I loved you in

what he's saying is that if Yahweh with

all the power and the greatness that he

has because look the smarter one is the

more one loves himself well if you don't

believe that look at the soccer stars do

you think they're humble - they look

humble to you the more

talent they have how much more do they

love themselves Wow way more way more

the more talent they've got and the more

prominent they are at something the more

they love themselves because they

appreciate the difference between

themselves and the rest they're like I'm

the champion and that's at all levels

that's all why do you think doctors are

so proud because they think they know

more than the rest and that your life

hangs on their hands what do you think

the pastor's are so proud because they

study theology a PhD it's like this

person being as he listens to me I don't

know if he does or not but there's a

person that comments on my timeline

whose name is Armando Romero you've seen

him right oh okay

Armando Romero is my first cousin a

first cousin of the family farewell

let's say we understand this he is a

great guy a great guy a great guy

there's a reason why I haven't

unfriended him that I replied to the

dumb garbage she says he is and was a

Seventh day Adventist pastor all his

life he was a very good friend of my

dad's he went and is living at Andrews I

don't know if he got himself a PhD or a

master's degree in theology and divinity

and he stopped being a pastor because

there were things that he didn't like

about the church but not about the

doctrine but the way that the church is

in the pastor's handled themselves

either like and he said I'm gonna stop

practicing he saw the title role but he

retired and started to do other jobs

which he found to be more propitious

than to dedicate himself to an

organization that he finds to have

certain mistakes not doctrinal but in

the organization and ever since we

started ever since I started study being

as we had a good relation he and I he's

a first cousin he's from the family I

explained everything to him but of

course he's a doctor and theology means

it but Gracie and I know every single

word in Greek because I started Greek I

could tell you how didn't just tell me a

thing

the thing is to understand what the

message is saying not for you to tell me

anything we

had a couple of very amiable chats Pinay

you know Tom okay Armando good I mean

don't worry about anything I'm not gonna

insist I'll never bother you again cuz I

don't insist on anybody not even my

mother nobody continue to worship but

worship and that's perfect it doesn't

bother me what you worship in very least

doesn't bother me continue to worship

whatever you'd like I won't bother you

again and I won't bother anybody and I

left them there on my timeline cuz he

doesn't bother anybody and I see that

lately he's been starting to comment to

get into it and reply to him if he

published a lot then I'll take him out

but you already know he's my cousin my

first cousin of the family who either

has either masters or a PhD in theology

which means he really knows Hebrew see

what I'm saying that's why I believe

that I made him jump mr. Armando I made

him jump

I made him jump at that video of that

turn tyrion pastor i posted because he's

extremely Trinitarian so then of course

it hurt him a little bit no matter of

that end or some pastor is an adventist

or not it hurt him that we were talking

they were laughing at these Trinitarians

that's what we wrote but don't attack

the people attack the doctrine the

extremely turnit aryan doctrine I'm just

letting you know don't start arguing

with him Yuriy know who he is

I'm alone if he bothers a lot then I'll

take him off but his mother and all that

much you already know that's family free

that's a family is that's a family is

and I mean that's the way it is right

the prisoners they're starving prisoners

they're starving slaves and why should

we argue done argue with the family it's

as far as it goes so then you already

know farewell then

so then I'll repeat this again because

this I mean did you like the correct

interpretation of verse nine that says

as the father hath loved me so have I

loved youth continue in my love what's

important here is that Yahweh is giving

a message to those who understand I love

you so much as I love myself remain in

my love that's what y'all was saying wow

if it had been written there wouldn't it

be marvelous it is written that way well

it's written parables right it is

written parables

I'll repeat it again yahwah is telling

us i love you so much as i love myself

and look i am Elohim i am all-powerful

there's no one more powerful than i am

and you I love you so much as much as I

love myself but I mean that text right

there is rather incredible once you

discover the parable Wow

what love does Elohim have for us I love

you as much as I love myself Wow

rather brutal just like that bru tell I

love you as much as myself remain in my

love and how can we remain in his love

how how can we remain in his love by

keeping his Commandments it says there

by keeping his Commandments Wow huh

brutal there we notice that he loved his

bride so much that he came and gave his

life for her Wow

and now something else gonna make sense

which I tell the truth well it's

difficult what I'm about to say but tell

the truth it never made all that much

sense to me I accepted it I spoke of it

I everything but it never really made

all that much sense to me but I'm about

to tell you let's first go to verse 10

10 but remember that text as the father

hath loved me so have I loved you what a

marvelous message directly from Yahweh

from Yahweh whenever you feel like not

keeping his Commandments all you have to

do is think about that text and the love

that yahwah has for us that he loves us

as himself 10 if you keep my

Commandments you shall abide in my love

even as I have kept my father's

Commandments and abide in his love

obviously he kept what Commandments

those of Yahweh those of Yahweh did he

keep him as a human being of course he

did these things have I spoken unto you

that my joy might remain in you and that

your joy might be full Wow my joy be in

you and your joy might be full our joy

is not full at all we're still waiting

for him to come to look for us and

someday it'll be filled in a way which

we cannot even fathom but we start to

comprehend already that yahoo loves us

as much as he loves himself do you think

that a person that says that as his his

his bride or his elect as servants no of

course not of course not he says that he

loves us to the same level as him do you

understand what y'all was saying wow

that is incredible this is my

commandment he says that ye love one

another as I have loved you and he loves

us as himself and he says you have to

love yourselves as I have loved you as

myself so then that is the central

message that is why he says of these two

Commandments hang all the laws and the

prophets all of it 13 and here comes

what I'm about to tell you no man hath

greater love than this that a man lay

down his life for his friends so then

you sure says I love you so much as much

as I love myself and I'm gonna give my

life for you who are my friends but no

one and there's no greater love than

this that a man lay down his life for

his friends how many times have you read

this text do you know it pretty much by

memory okay there's a problem there is a

problem with this text here we've

already understood that his friends are

his bride because I've told you that

there really isn't true friendship

between a man and a woman doesn't exist

unless it's his wife Fred the friendship

between a man and a woman does not exist

it doesn't exist there could be a

friendship that's very very very from

afar but a friendship to sit down and

chat to sit down and talk

to go to their house to go shopping to

sit down and eat and then later to sleep

know it immediately leads to sleeping

together do you understand because

whoever says that there can be

friendship between a man and a woman is

a liar I've already told you long ago

there is no friendship with this exist a

certain companionship because we're

lineage but not friendship friendship to

sit down and talk at a table face to

face alone that's friendship that's

friendship go with me here golden there

that's friendship and when there's that

what always happens what starts is all

the feelings the feelings start and man

doesn't go any further with the woman

because maybe she doesn't allow it but I

was watching a video in which they were

asking some college girls in the US I

mean I just quickly telling you you

don't even have to go look for the video

or anything like that and that just that

when I've seen lots of video where they

try to demonstrate to the women because

women do think that they can be just

friends you know why because they don't

feel what man feels so then they were

asking these girls do you think that men

and women can be just friends yeah I

have a whole bunch of guy friends

they asked men do you they asked these

guys if they believe in a friendship

between a man and a woman and they were

like yeah but then they were like well

right because the next question was and

would you like to sleep with her you

know in a friend you know there's always

those friends our just friends but then

other sudden they asked him would you

ever sleep with her yes or no and if she

wanted to then of course their

friendship was broken there but almost

like those are your intentions

you see that's what happens it's normal

it is normal a man and a woman as

friends one caress more will caress last

he just relaxed a couple muscles as

Amanda says right because there be some

muscles that get tense and being Azam's

we were all friends already okay men and

women can't just be friends so then when

you show calls his friends he's calling

us precisely his bride his bride so then

it says there isn't there is no greater

love

than this that a man lay down his life

for his friends or his bright this

requires that we add just and understand

another text that was our base this text

contradicts John 3:16 Wow I've just

touched the heart of the atone fruit

that's the very text that I said I would

touch on John 3:16 what does it say it

goes as follows for God so loved the

world that He gave His only Son Monohan

s and we were synthetic insane his son

more not heinous the only one born of

him his mana genetic his only begotten

mono is one so much emphasis in fact we

started say you see how there is no

Trinity because Yahweh the father gave

his son and his son is not just a role

we said that came out of my mouth it's

not just a role because if it were a

role he would be a liar so then the

father gave his son that whosoever

believeth on him not perish but have

eternal life for Yahweh did not give his

son that the world perish but for what

that the world be saved through him Wow

that text now well isn't it just

terrible it is I mean that text if we

misunderstand it it takes us to annul

the Shema because it says for God so

loved the world Yahweh that eloheem that

God you have there there's no other God

for an Israelite outside of Yahweh so

then you can directly say Yahweh for

Yahweh so loved the world that He gave

His only begotten Son

already if we understand it the way we

understood it yahwah has an only

begotten son and he gave him

and of course that's where all my

explanations come in about why y'all we

didn't come why didn't you become and

then the Sun comes whom we understood to

be that and is hold on I'm the creator

was not yet with a creator no I am the

creator and that is we get a whole lot

of contradictions that up to the date

2018 we had them if you didn't know that

or don't believe it

we had them so them never that I see

love in a father that gives his son ever

I saw that as egotistical right because

I'm not going tell my son egotistical to

the fullest if we understand that the

dead gave his son

we as sinful evil men do the contrary as

long as my son so then if there's some

sort of problem should I send my son to

be killed or do I cause a father the

father goes forth an evil man an evil

man an evil man like lot what'd he do he

wanted to send his two daughters he was

given away his two daughters is that

what you call love so then that's why

I'm now touching on the very heart of

the eternal truth not just any text mind

you John 3:16 why I told you that today

subject was gonna be strong John 3:16

what does John 3:16 mean did you know

that this text no man hath greater love

than this that a man lay down his life

for his friends not for one to send the

life of his son for his friends Yeshua

is here declaring what does John 3:16

say which he himself said it he's saying

what it says do you see it if you don't

see it don't you worry but you sure gave

the explanation of John 3:16 John 3:16

is understandable with what Yeshua is

explaining here no man hath greater love

than this that a man lay down his life

for his friends

imagine that you continue to believe or

the way we've played before that there

was a father of the sent his son another

son says no one has greater love than I

who I'm gonna give my own life but what

about your dad so loving the world

ironically he say no not even his love

he sent me today what kind of love is

that love is what I have listen well to

this because it's very good if if you

still think that one father sent her son

to die the son says have a greater love

them the father because I will give my

life for my friends what did the father

do not send his own son to die Wow what

love of the father

you know that's horrible start to think

about it what type of father sends his

own son that's what I told you calm down

I see your faces you're fighting against

everything you believed don't fight it

is illogical it isn't logical to send

this one son to die when the one who

should have come with the one who

created them or not very well then

you sure explains that text and says no

one hath greater love than this that a

man lay down his life not that of his

sons not that of his father's not that

of any others his own life for his

friends in John 3:16 says for God so

loved the world that he had given his

only begotten son we now know that

Elohim is Yahweh this text reads as

follows for a Yahweh so loved the world

that he came as an only begotten Son

that's what he's really saying but in

parables don't try to look for your own

versions yeah God reason the purified

version but that one's pure fight

bacterial is about it you should speak

in in parables that's the way it should

stay in parables he said for Elohim so

loved the world that he had given his

only begotten Son Elohim is Yahweh for

Yahweh so loved the world that he came

to die as an only begotten Son that

whosoever that believeth on him not

perish but have eternal life for Yahweh

hath not sent his son who's the same

person yahwah did not send himself in

the form of a son to condemn the world

but that the world be saved through him

he that believeth on him what must we

believe that you're sure is Yahweh

that's what we might believe in

because if I believe in Yeshua I heard

believe in you sure and in Yahweh I've

got two Elohim no no the one that

believeth on him to believe that you

sure is Yahweh who is not condemned but

he that believeth not is condemned

already because he had not believed in

the name of the only begotten son of

Elohim in the name of the only begotten

Son of man that son of man is of Elohim

perfectly well cuz he was also born from

Elohim and once we understand this

parable there is no other name of that

Tanakh in which we could be saved but

what name Yahweh Yahweh so then when

Yeshua says that we can only be saved in

the name of Elohim is sure he's saying

that he's still Yahweh but he now comes

under the name of Yeshua is this

understood or have you any doubts here

you better listen to me here it's

Claire's water against clears water I

like that and this is the condemnation

that the light came the light came into

the world you see the light came into

the world he is the light yah was the

light and men love darkness rather than

light because their deeds were evil for

every one that doeth evil hateth the

light neither cometh to the light lest

his deeds should be reproved but he he

that practices the truth he that

practices truth and the truth begins in

the in the Tanakh starting with the

Torah he that practices the truth cometh

to the light that his deeds may be made

manifest that they are wrought in Elohim

or in Yahweh this is marvelous just like

that that's why I've told you that we're

gonna be advancing in the subject of the

Shema the Shema changes everything it

changes it all less man that's why I

asked you this morning did you see

anything about what you used to believe

that there are two or one know and

insert anything no no no no there's

still more left but this is the heart of

it all John 3:16 with this text we said

yes sure is a begotten son because it

says it here and Elohim sent his son and

that's how I demonstrate his love he

didn't demonstrate any

love here issue a said there's no

greater love than this for what to put

one's own life for his friends that's

what he's saying he's explaining John

3:16 you see it if he doesn't explain it

then he's criticizing his father let's

suppose it's true

just like that crazily at some point in

time now so that you see this Yahweh

sends a son his son says yahwah says

there's no greater than the father who

sends his son when the Sun comes says

hey there's no greater than of mine my

father sent me is that love the greater

one is here I who placed my own life for

my friends that's what love is so then

there you see that it is a contradiction

it is a it cannot be the only thing that

could be makes liar the father right he

makes the father a liar I mean if that

situation were to exist then he makes a

liar out of the father but what reality

is absolutely clear if you don't

understand it don't you don't you worry

Yahweh came into the world in the form

of a human being made him something

called the issuer and when he would

refer to Yahweh it is written but how

would he make him something call to the

father my father your father whatever

I'll him as well whatever but he was the

son of man and so then he said that the

father demonstrate his love and give him

the son then he explains in the same

book he explains that there's no greater

than love than this that I give my love

for my friends so then that is where

that text is absolutely left clear very

well and it says and if I could well

I'll go ahead and read I'll go ahead and

read it cuz I don't want you to post it

there and say look at what I found the

Spanish version called the new purified

Bible it is by people who didn't keep

the law or anything but believe in only

Jesus for example the only Jesus is

similar to what I present today but it's

not only Jesus but only Yahweh ours see

the difference

only Yahweh that's ours that yahwah came

as you sure that's perfect that Yahweh

is obviously the holy spirit I mean

that's obvious

but we are understanding the doctrine of

Yahweh that's what we're doing we're not

only Jesus one's Yahweh past normative

being Jesus they stayed with Jesus we

didn't stay with just Jesus you sure had

you sure had

ministry on earth but we don't worship

your sure and you show only for the rest

of our lives but whom Yahweh because you

sure is Yahweh and he goes back to being

what he was before in our worship he is

sure then I'm worshiping when he took in

a minimized form of that body do you

follow when I comprehend that Yeshua is

Yahweh I continue worshiping home Yahweh

I never changed him the difference is

that I accept that Yahweh rendered

himself so as to die for his wife but

once he renders himself to die he goes

back and he says I go to the Father

which means is that he goes back to his

condition of been Yahweh all-powerful so

then we are not the only Jesus folk but

who only Yahweh only our folk that's why

the only Jesus don't keep the law

nothing does Joshua abolished everything

they say do you think y'all were

abolished zone law he abolished it to be

able to remarry but he said if you love

me keep the commandments I love you just

as much as I love myself now we

understand that he says I love you as

much as myself that I give my life for

you and there's no greater love than

this do you see this this absolutely

marvelous I don't know if I have ever

spoken about a subject that's so

profound it marvelous as the one I am

presenting to you today which is Wow

no matter if I spoke to you about the

Shema last week had you ever seen John

3:16 it is marvelous it is absolutely

marvelous I'll read it to you once again

in this version they need purified

version but it was not what it was

written Amun sure know that these guys

corrected but I don't correct what is

written I explained what is written I

explained it but we keep it the way it's

written unless they had things like that

about the name of the Father Holy Spirit

that's been added we deleted that but

not just cuz it bothers me that's been

added it's been proven but that which

has been written parables how should it

be in parables only some understand it

that's all I explain it but I don't

rewrite that pear bowl set by you sure

and I don't rewrite it no longer in the

form of parable are you following very

well then these guys ventured into

rewriting it and it came out well but

it's not

you said for elohim so loved the world

that He has given himself as an only

begotten Son that whosoever believeth in

him not perish yet have eternal life for

Elohim did not send himself as only

begotten Son to condemn the world on the

contrary that the world be saved by him

he that believeth on him is not

condemned but he that not believeth has

already been condemned for he had not

believed in the name of the only son of

Elohim okay if I write it like that I've

already removed the parable from there

but I mean it is direct straightforward

but that now people still don't

understand they don't comprehend and the

people that wrote this Bible would never

comprehend it either because they are

only Jesus folk they're only Jesus

with Paul

what could they ever understand Tommy

right Paul is the architect but they do

understand what he's saying there they

do understand what you saying there very

well then let me see-oh with this 144

how I like that our 144 I'd liked it you

know what I wanted to read something to

you since we're already and it is good

at John 3 let's go to John 3 because I'm

gonna explain to you why John the

Baptist died do you know why John the

Baptist died do you who are

knowledgeable folk about the truth why

John the Baptist died tell me farewell

then who killed John the Baptist

King Herod King Herod farewell then

Herod and that's fine all of you said

two things but I'll go further John

three and I'm gonna correct here

something in scripture which you don't

have corrected but I'm gonna correct it

for you and I'm gonna mark this here in

my Bible

okay then very well let's see let me

mark here because otherwise I'm gonna

mark here because they made John say

things that John doesn't say but you

shoe said don't ask me for the reason

why but obviously what supposedly was

said by John he didn't say but G shoe

did cuz it's part of the discourse but

oh well let's read it here let us start

from let's take for granted that of

Nicodemus and I'll start with ragazza

loved and 16 and on for Lehane so loved

the world that He gave His only begotten

Son that whosoever believeth in him

should not perish but have everlasting

life for Allah him sent not his son into

the world to condemn the world but that

the world through him might be saved he

that believeth on him is not condemned

but he that believeth not is condemned

already because he hath not believed in

the name of the only begotten son of

Elohim and this is the condemnation that

the light is coming to the world and Men

loved darkness rather than light because

their deeds were evil for every one that

doeth evil hateth the light neither

cometh to the light lest his deeds

should be reproved but he that doeth

truth cometh to the light that his deeds

may be made manifest that they are

wrought in Elohim after these things but

the Jew clearly understand John 3:16

through 18 to clearly understand it did

you get that there's no father and son

they're the same person that gave

himself up is the one speaking well huh

magnificently impressive it was

necessary that you would comprehend that

you know why because house you show good

and come and look for us and we're still

thinking that the father sent the son

and I said from that if the son was the

Creator why is the father getting a

medal in his son's creation and what is

the son always say I don't know anything

of myself tell talk to me by the father

you see how what my tight butt is this

guy so dumbass a son he did no thing it

is not a thing as a son and then he says

I do everything because of my father

and I said because of my father until

you relate the two and you say all I

speak is by our way I am Yahweh speaking

of Yahweh everything has been left

clearly I am glad bear with him but what

about all those that left before this

they won't get this message they

continuing with the father and the son

and what about those making the

one-minute videos I mean they are left

with the father and the son and those

that go elsewhere all the ones that left

left with what with the father and the

son they need that have not that

doctrine of the father and son do not

welcome him it says Wow

okay but that everything about John will

study later because we've got to

continue reading and understanding very

well then

here comes but I want to explain why

John died and who killed them now you're

gonna say this get really lost his mind

no I haven't lost my head after these

things came Yeshua with his disciples

into the land of Judea and there he

turned with them and baptized so then

the disciples of what take okay please

pay attention here okay I'm bringing ten

to twenty two John 3:22 it says that the

disciples obvious sure were baptizing

although elsewhere it clearly says that

it was not you sure about December the

disciples it says that he would baptize

you are following right okay start to

imagine this in your mind and John also

was baptizing in Aenon near to Salem

because there was much water there and

they came and were baptized for John was

not yet cast into prison do you know

when John the Baptist was thrown into

prison approximately a year after he

baptized yushua

but I want you to understand something

that you haven't had very they mentioned

I'm about to tell you it's when you sure

came and he started his ministry he

started by getting baptized by John that

is clear right in fact he took two of

his disciples are out of the disciples

of John we've already studied that very

well then

and now a year after they come a year

after that they come and tell John here

there's a problem do you remember that

guy you baptized the guy you said was

the mashiac the lamb they're like he's

also baptizing and he's more successful

than us there's a problem here John do

you see a problem there there is a great

problem there a continue reading I'll

explain it later with man words then

there arose a question between John's

disciples whose disciples Jones notice

that Yeshua are I've been with this

ministry for a year and Yeshua wasn't

just anybody

he was Yahweh on earth and the Jews

about purifying that purification is

baptism precisely as it turns out a

whole discussion started but we're sure

to get baptized just imagine you're an

Israelite and you're like John this

baptism here and you show us baptism

here where should I go let's see here

which one is closer who of the two is

closer let's see what does John preach

which of the twos preachings dah like

maybe you like John more than you sure

there's a grave problem here and I'm

gonna say what that grave problem is and

why they cut off John the Baptist's head

I'll tell you before reading anything

you sure had John the Baptist killed who

had him killed but our art tells us

before he's gonna cost to die in a cost

to live I kill it says who kills why did

John the Baptist die because John didn't

want to end his ministry in the moment

in which yahwah came to earth and he

said this is the lamb of elohim who

taketh away the sin of the world

why didn't he become Yeshua's first

disciple why didn't say yeah sure

this is far as I go I mean what I don't

wanna use certain words because then I'm

criticized what am I talking about here

what what I mean what the hell am I

gonna tell the people repent but if

Yahweh came that is Yahweh that is the

lamb of elohim this is a make any sense

of heat containing to baptize their

tummy no questions tell me does it make

any sense does it make any sense for him

to continue have disciples there when

the one

Kame was the top notch

commander-in-chief King of the Jews do

you know what John had to have done it's

my last day all of my followers all of

my disciples I make myself a follower

and disciple of this man here all of you

that believe in me don't believe in me

anymore

believe in him cuz I preached about him

I don't have anymore message to give you

because my message which should prepare

the way for him but if I'm gonna

continue with my own path parallel to

his for an entire year I'll tell you

sure got upset he said it's off with his

head just like that cuz John would not

stop with his ministry when should have

John stopped with it in what Sabbath

school have you heard what I've just

said can't say it's a hey I mean energy

white I started to review what that old

 hag said Jesus was so sad when

he was given the news of the death of

his friend and cousin John and retired

to the side to cry

Jesus crying for someone's death weddin

he cry for Lazarus death cuz he said

he's sleeping frailer him there is no

dead people there's no such thing as

that people Elohim is an eloheem of

living people not of dead people so then

for eloheem they'll live he said it if

I'm Elohim and I know that I've got up

okay let's say this computer if I don't

connect the disk and the computer is

reading it it is alive as soon as I

disconnect the computer says the dis

died and I who I'm the owner said no I

didn't die he's here i plug it in

wherever I won't it didn't die it'll

come there's like it died cuz I can't

read it anymore it got disconnected that

disk is dead after celica Peter no it

isn't dead I have the disc here and have

all the information of the disk and

whenever I see fit I'll connect it but

the disk isn't dead for it to be dead as

that I break it there this could die you

do get this right so then you should

says death does not exist to me be

afraid if I were to destroy eternally

that would matter but why are you crying

lasers he cried because he was so upset

he said Lazarus sleeps

and when Jesus when you sure died I said

Jesus because I was reading that

Ellen

but Yeshua why did he cry because he's

so angry that they didn't they were all

screaming and crying if they see was

assured all word by Lazarus

okay so then why are you sure supposedly

could have become sad because of John's

death not true his life it isn't true

that he became sad let's start there

it's not true that he got sad and maybe

if something did games had is because he

had to get to kill him yet to off him

because the guy didn't want to get off

of his position you have John the

Baptist preaching here and you should

preaching in the other side of town I

mean this happens to all the ignorant

fools

who believe themselves to be something

but when that which is true comes they

don't say no what are we gonna preach

about if what you're preaching is so

superior to mine that I'm not gonna

contribute anything we don't we good in

tribute no I want another kadosh path

cuz I've got what are you talking about

there are ignorant fools every last one

of them because when someone superior

comes the rest shuts their mouth because

when they open it they say nothing but

dump garbage and when the one that has

the truth speaks the truth the rest want

to adorn it and they ruin it so just

shut the hell up and listen to whom you

have to listen that's what happened to

John the Baptist John the Baptist felt

the power because he had so much power

that even the Pharisees were scared of

him

that's what it says they're scared John

Baptist John the Baptist was the son of

a priest

Zechariah his father was a priest so

then he knew the law the way the priests

do it was not like those preachers that

speak like not knowing anything John

knew it all are you following John was a

Levite if the priests and the collectors

would come and listen to him John had

some to say or not yet some say but you

see what happens it immense pride if one

does not control he knows not whom he

works for on reality came he should have

shut down that ministry that very same

take not just shut it down

nobody should have been able to separate

him from Yeshua if he would preach about

Yeshua if he preached about Yahweh and

he believed his own words what did he

have to do from that point on to follow

him with her server he goeth imagine now

that all of a sudden I don't know it

says some crazy some crazy let's say

that yahwah comes today and he has a

conference in Vegas the real Yahweh so

y'all was in Vegas I know he's in Vegas

this tschappat I say well those of you

that want to listen in Vegas you can do

so but we're gonna have this ship at the

bride of you sure 23 but you should

speeching on earth but I say I have to

go on with my message because this is

chapter 23 we're continuing with 24 next

to bat and if you want the real ones

over there because I you know John said

he is the lamb yeah he's the lamb but

I'm also here you've got the land that

taketh away and I home a bad sob and

since I preach well and you like what I

speak

whatever I say you like the way speak

okay there you have another option

y'all was over there in Vegas or Miami

or wherever but since used to what I

speak you want to listen to me where am

I gonna end up tell me where would I end

up I'd end up in the lake of fire but

I'm talking in no time and a blink of an

eye so then what what was the mistake of

John the Baptist when he saw you sure

and comprendo do you sure was to say I

mean my minister here is over yes or no

minister is over but just look at the

huge problem they had here what's it say

then there arose a question between

John's disciples John got to such a

point of even doubting and he said are

you the one that was to come or should

we wait for another Wow and John said

that of course of course John John the

pride the pride of the attention of the

people it started to dominate John

believe it or not because if we don't

let go of his post when you see a person

that doesn't want to let go of his post

it's because they don't understand what

they are

now I'm not saying that he won't be

saved not the very least John will be

saved entirely but you sure had to help

them you sure had to help them by Dawn

I'm it's enough John it's over John and

you had to give him a little help a

slight push so then there was a question

then there are also question between

some of John's disciples and the Jews

about purifying which is baptism by

water and they came unto John and said

unto Him rabbi rabbi which means my

teacher rub-rub teacher rabbi my teacher

rabboni or Robinho's Rubino is our

master right our teacher southern notice

well what i've just said the same thing

with Adonai

you see I don't Donnie Adonai this is

Robbie they said my master how Tommy was

he still a teacher having the king of

Israel who wants a teacher let's all go

and listen to I mean what wisdom could

John the Baptist impart once y'all can

tell me how would did he continue to say

these are my disciples why didn't he say

please stop following me I don't have

anything else to give what am I gonna

give the one I preached about is there

he's the savior of Israel don't listen

to me anymore

cuz I'm off to follow him in fact you

still want to follow me you want to know

where to find me

right in front of him but on a permanent

basis and don't listen to me anymore I

want to listen to him to him do you find

this it makes sense what I'm telling you

or do you find it insane no it's correct

absolutely absolutely he continued to

force that ministry being the king here

well so then to top it off about a year

went by give or take so you sure got

upset and it was off with his head

now do you understand why Yeshua cut his

head off it was not Herod it wasn't

anything

you sure cut his head off John as far as

you go that's it it's over that's the

only way I can save you so then it says

then a discussion arose between Simon

John's disciples and Jews of perfume and

they came to John and said unto Him

rabbi behold he that was with thee

lookit look at what's going on rabbi

well that was with you on the other side

of the Jordan Tim the barest witness be

Aldi baptizeth and they all come to him

we're losing followers here rabbi what

do we do here you know what I mean

what's going on here he has more power

than you but I mean what's going on John

answered and said a man can receive

nothing except it be given him from

heaven ye yourselves bear me witness

that I said I am NOT the Messiah but

that I am sent before him John

understood it clearly but there was a

grave problem he wanted to continue to

have a group of followers are you

following he had a problem but what he

says here is spectacular

he that hath the bride is the bridegroom

Wow but notice here's something he is as

if he draws away from the bride I don't

know why he instead of saying I want to

be a part of the bride look here he that

hath the bride is the bridegroom now

who's the bride Israel that one of us

the followers is the bridegroom who's

the bridegroom Yeshua but the friend of

the bridegroom which stand it beside him

here with him he saw himself as what as

the friend of the bridegroom not as the

bride wow I don't wanna be a friend of

Barkham I want to be the bride

completely the bride

I don't want it right because if you go

to the wedding and the one that gets

married is the friend of the bridegroom

I mean what I'm trying to say here is

how far can getting at matrimony nowhere

absolutely nowhere and even more of you

in love with the bridegroom and he's

gonna get marry with another I don't

know yeah you know you should get

married to me not to that broad do you

understand

okay so then you sure but I mean this is

spectacular he that hath the bride is

the bridegroom John is right but the

friend of the bridegroom which standeth

and heareth him rejoiceth greatly

because of the bridegroom's voice this

then is my joy and therefore it's

fulfilled so then he is content with

what we've been the firm nothing else it

is necessary that he increase but I must

decrease it is necessary he should have

disappeared but he's like you see there

was a problem in this personality he

understood the truth he believed that

he believed in Yeshua but his acts were

not to follow him right he wanted to

continue preaching he wanted to be

another witness maybe another another

that's I've got the Godhead the Camino

Kadosh folk the kadosh paths so then

that right there is the problem it is

necessary that he increase he need not

increase it was Yahweh he was everything

and that I decrease you disappeared who

the heck are you John the Baptist hope

from the moment you preached him that's

it it's over now

what comes after verse 31 John never

said it but rather it was said by issuer

it's just that the scribes for some odd

reason made it look like John said it

there are many people who are great

scholars I don't know they have a lot of

wisdom or not great scholars say no

clearly the way of writing and what he's

saying was never sent by John it is a

part of what you sure has been saying

and I'm about to demonstrate it but I've

just said about verse 31 the words of

John ended with he must increase but I

must decrease those were the words of

John and those were the last things he

said cuz right after that a very short

period afterward he messed with Herod

when he shouldn't even mess with him

and Aaron took him as a prisoner and cut

his head off it's over but that's how he

ended what would have happened what

would have happened if he had made

himself a disciple of you sure obviously

did you have the power of taking them

out of prison wanted obviously so then

why did you should not intervene but he

did intervene with lasers and one and

resurrected him why why because it was

necessary since he didn't understand any

other way he put him to rest don't mean

he's not gonna be saved not the very

least it means that the show was like I

don't need you anymore and if you didn't

get the picture then I'm gonna have to

put you and standby on standby

I'll hold on hold I put your hold was

this understood or not perfectly well

okay

farewell now I shall read once again

well you sure

been talking about Yeshua says in 19 and

this is the condemnation that the light

is come into the world and men love

darkness rather than light because their

deeds were evil for every one that doeth

evil hateth the light neither cometh to

the light lest his deeds should be

reproved but he that doeth truth cometh

to the light that his deeds may be made

manifest that they are wrought in Elohim

now Reid 31 he that cometh from above

Yeshua is speaking he's talking about

the son talking about the son that

Elohim is given into the world these are

not words of John but rather of the

issuer put it down on your Bibles

because otherwise what happens is that

with beer 6000 year old mind you'll

forget later he that cometh from above

is above all obviously issues speaking

he that is of the earth is earthly in

speaketh of the earth that includes John

the Baptist he that cometh from heaven

is above all he's speaking about

precisely the you see how you sure has

been talking about the Sun given by

Elohim which is himself but that's what

he's saying he comes from heavens

talking about that never did John the

Baptist understand this and what he had

seen and heard that he testified and no

man receiveth his testimony

who's speaking there you sure is

speaking it's not John do you follow it

but in your Bibles you have it as if

John said it right exactly in John say

it it says he that hath received this

testimony had set as a shield that

Elohim is true for a he he'll mellow he

had sent speaketh the words of Elohim

for Elohim giveth not the spirit by

measure obviously speaking about you

sure he didn't give it what do you mean

by measure if he's entirely Elohim the

father loveth the son you see that these

are not words of John because John ever

mentioned the son or anything the father

loveth the son who is the same person

the father Yahweh loveth Yeshua and all

things have he given into his hand he

that believeth on the son hath

everlasting life those words will be

assured not of John are you following

this if John would have said that y'see

stop preaching

he that believeth on the son hath

everlasting life and he that believeth

not the son shall not see life but the

wrath of Elohim abideth on him and that

is where chapter 3 ends but those are

words of Yeshua continued from verse 21

in other words at 21 then 31 and that is

where we find the story of the problem

of John of John's problem from 22 to 30

would be at the end of that chapter are

you following okay then very well it was

over a year preaching by himself then of

course they started to fight amongst

themselves John's disciples issues

disciples to ministry side-by-side when

we know that Yahweh's what they had he's

won he's won and the time is well this

topic sure is fascinating right to

understand these things are fascinating

because if you just show comes I will

shut down the ministry immediately that

very second I'll throw it all out I'll

even break the computer into like this

so that you see what all I want to do is

be next to see should see what he says

what am I gonna be wasting time with you

guys you guys handle yourselves what I'm

gonna speak it is he that I want to

listen to obviously all of you deal with

things yourselves five or new favorite

neo don't remember you if I've ever met

you I do not remember you so then so

then again I'll read thirteen we're on

John 15:13 says for no man had greater

love than this that a man lay down his

life for his friends

ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I

command you henceforth I'll call you not

servants oh thanks for that because

there are people that still want to be

servant servant servants henceforth I

call you not servants what part of that

don't you understand henceforth I'll

call you not servants for the servant

knoweth not what his Lord doeth

obviously the servant is a brute a slave

does no thing but I have called you

friends for all things that I have heard

of my father of Yahweh I have made known

unto

you but in parables how doesn't make

them known unto us Wow in parables here

it says marvelous you have not chosen me

wait here it is not your choice ye have

not chosen me but I have chosen you that

is what you call predestination

absolutely I'll read it again just to

get you be understand

ye have not chosen me but I have chosen

you and ordained you that you should go

and bring forth fruit and that your

fruit should remain that whatsoever you

shall ask of Yahweh of the Father in my

name in the name of Yeshua he may give

it to you in other words I give it to

you same thing absolute predestination

these things I command you that ye love

one another if the world hate you you

know that it hated me before it hated

you hold on a moment here when did the

world hate you schewe when is it right

there he's saying he's Yahweh you know

why because the one who was rejected

first was Yahweh throughout all the

prophets which he would send and they

would kill him yes or no but here you

sure says that the world rejected him

before them but practically he came

together with the disciples do you

follow so then one was assured this in

the form of yahwah before of ously

absolutely clear I'll read it again so

you understand it reads as follows if

the world hate you not that it hated me

before you its hated me my whole life

Israel rejected yeah with the whole time

I had to get her out take her to Babylon

and all the rest nineteen Havey were of

the world av were of the world the world

would love his own but because ye are

not of the world but I have chosen you

out of the world therefore the world

hated you I'll read in Jerusalem 2001 it

says if ye were of the world the world

would love his own but since ye are not

of the world because I being as I have

chosen you I've taken out of the world

that is why the world hates you

it is talking about absolute

predestination twenty

remember the word that I said unto you

the servant is not greater than his Lord

if they have persecuted me they will

also persecute you if they have kept my

sane they will keep yours also if they

have kept my word you should use gonna

play words here ironically that the

world keep his word so then he says in

the same way they'll keep yours he's not

keeping to the disciples if you keep my

words I'll write again because it is an

ironical way of speaking

he's extremely ironical remember the

word that I said unto you the servant is

not greater than his Lord if they have

persecuted me they will also persecute

you if they have kept my word that the

world keep his word never they will keep

yourself so so then you guys are gonna

have yes you're saying if I had success

in the world you'll have the same

success as I did that is what he's

saying look I'll read a different

version NLT New Living Translation says

John 1520 what I told you a slave is not

greater than his master since they

persecuted me naturally they will

persecute you and if they have listened

to me they would listen to you so then

they'll never listen to you spanish DHH

remember this that I told you no servant

is greater or more than is Lord if they

had persecuted me they shall persecute

you also if they have paid attention to

my word

if they have paid attention to my words

they also pay attention to yours

so then that's why you should says

you're not gonna have much success look

at me how many people listen to me

and if you preach the truth success is

not something you'll have failure is in

other words failure a few followers

humanly speaking is failure okay I want

to restructure my words the truth is the

issue has a few chosen and their Church

is right of course the churches are

replete but those are not the chosen

ones that's what when you should have

said only a few those like don't worry

the same success that I have

but you see that it's very few people

that is the same success that you'll

have but it's true success that is what

I want I don't want you gathered the

multitude cuz he says why do I speak to

them in parables why is everything in

parables why that they don't understand

because what happens if they understand

then I'd have to save them if they

understand I'd have to save them that's

why I speak in parables so they don't

understand cuz if they do I'd have to

save them

farewell then so then we're a few will

always be very few so then if you

understand this eternal truth consider

yourself to be very loved by Yahweh

because in loved by Yahweh cuz otherwise

you won't understand it you won't

understand it

yahwah says he loves us the way he loves

himself if you understand that we could

be so ugly

such dummies so limited but Yahweh

all-powerful Yahweh says that he loves

us as much as himself so then he's

planning for us to give him he's

planning to make something of us as

great as he is I've been telling you the

divine nature that he has we shall have

but only those obedient that love him if

they don't love him obviously they

cannot remain in his love you should

says the way I love you remain in my

love and how do we remain in his love

while keep my Commandments you remain in

my love so then those who remain in his

love will be as great as Elohim this is

absolutely marvelous

let's see 21 but all these things will

they do unto you for my name's sake

because they know not him that sent me

obviously they don't know him no one can

understand who yo is if there aren't

said who Yeshua is because it's the same

person if I had not come if you sure had

not come if the son of men had not come

if the son of Elohim had not come if I

had not come and spoken unto you they

had not had sin notice he's talking

about Israel he says that if he had not

come they would not have sinned because

they were still worshiping Yahweh did

you know that after the exile of Babylon

after

exile of Babylon all the Weizmann got

together yeah and they said we've got to

do something so as to never deviate from

Yahweh and if there's anything right

that these people did those rebellious

lot was to place y'all way and never

deviate obviously the whole doctrine is

false but they didn't change of Elohim

they tried not to change of Allah Haim

what good was it it didn't help them at

all because if they don't accept the

Elohim that came here who is the assure

they cannot accept the other one because

it's the same person it's exactly the

same thing so then look at what he says

if I had not come and spoken unto them

in other words if Yahweh

I'm explained to you what is written you

already understand if Yahweh have not

come in and that's spoken unto them they

had not had sinned but now they have no

excuse for their sin now they're screwed

why are they screwed because they

believe in y'all before and they did

everything that supposedly yahwah said

but from the moment in which i came he

says it is over

no more option of pray unto Yahweh

without accepting me because yahwah came

here on a different form and since

yahwah came in a different form you can

no longer reject that form and say no

i'm gonna continue on with yahweh no no

no I accept that new form of yeshua but

once you accept the new form of yeshua

you sure makes you understand that he is

Yahweh so then you continue to worship

Yahweh understanding y'all was you sure

do you notice but what did everybody do

you sure it's not Yahweh we worship

Yahweh you see the difference can they

obtain salvation like that you sure says

they can't use us as they can't 22 or 23

so then which in 22 what is the problem

all these Jews who is what is the

problem but they still invoke the name

of Yahweh the whole time but it is to no

avail

another than invoke his name they say

what Hashem Adonai but let's suppose

they invoke him that's suppose they do

invoke him let's suppose that they say

that Shabbat every day that they tied

here that the tied here let it be said

this the Shema but in Hebrew the

Teversham all over the place what good

is it that you should say not at all

because I came and they don't accept me

so then it no longer matters this works

for you if you accept who came

that of course it helps you if you

accept who came he that hate if me say

Athiya schewe

hated my father also it is very clear if

we reject your show with Jack Yahweh for

what reason because he has shown y'all

was the same person because Yahweh loved

the world so much that he gave his own

life for his bride that is what he's

saying so then when he came to give his

life he was rejected then we

automatically reject Yahweh he that

rejected me also rejected my father if I

had not done first he said if had not

come and had spoken to them you see now

he changes the words he is Elohim he

plays with the words if I had not done I

didn't just come to speak but also he

did what he did in other words he came

he spoke to them and also he did if I

had not done among them the worst which

none other man did they had not had sin

so then he came he spoke to them and did

things that no one had done that

demonstrated it was what Yahweh

absolutely Yahweh so then he says if I

had done among them the works which no

mother men did they had not had sin but

now they have both seen and have hated

both me and my father Wow

how magnificent it is to understand

these things and we thought we need the

whole Godhead I never felt pride of

understanding anything because I still

have that hunger of true knowledge

permanently that is why many years ago

we said we're not gonna put up before we

had our beliefs what if we would sit

down and read our beliefs now no I mean

I don't even know how many beliefs we

had it was terror on are many but in one

of those we believe in two divine beings

where would those beliefs end up now

wisely the Lord made me understand take

those beliefs out because we're gonna be

changing them as we move on one day

you'll go this way another day that way

because there are many folk in those

turns that you'll lose and I want you to

lose them because they are sons of aces

oh not mine they say they follow me but

they don't

in those turns that you're gonna give he

says some are gonna be let out they'll

fly out the same way they came they

don't belong here so then now we get to

year 2018 five thousand nine hundred

eighty seven one week from shove wort

from it turning into in the Z rent and

we close up this year with a brutal

golden seal with the golden sealed that

we had never thought of before

that the father is Yahweh that his son

Yeshua is the same person in even John

3:16 as saying that he sent himself now

that he have a father that's a different

story that we don't care about not in

the very least do we care about it my

father-in-law I don't care about him

that I'll meet him someday okay that's

fine but the entire scriptures did not

spit about my father-in-law it speaks

about my lone EMU is Yahweh and he says

you'll never know another one you'll

never have another one perfect Yahweh

that is my eloheem and that that Yahweh

came on earth she took a human form he

became the son of man also the son of

Elohim and there's still more left I

don't want you to get scandalized like

Yeshua says when you see that it would

seem that you should speaking to himself

was his father who was he sure praying

200 who was just sure praying to but

that will come in the following next

tschappat next you bet we'll see John 16

John 17 but I read on he says if had not

done among them the works which not

other men did he's demonstrated that he

is yahwah that'll be sane they would not

have sinned but now they have seen in a

rejected both me and my father

but this cometh to pass that the word

might be fulfilled that is written in

their law in your Torah they hated me

without a cause but when the comforter

has come when I will send unto you from

the father obviously it is him in a

spiritual way whom I will send from

Yahweh the Spirit of Truth for he is the

truth I am the truth he said which

proceedeth from the father obviously he

does not proceed to be assured proceed

from from Yahweh because your shells of

proceeds from Yahweh are you following

you should proceed from Yahweh the Holy

Spirit proceeds of Yahweh everything

despair

truth is Yahweh where the old Yahweh

folk it would seem as if we were the

Java witnesses but it's very different

because they believe Jesus to be a

different being now they'd have to be

crazy to believe that yahwah came down

here obviously so then it says which

proceeded from the father from Yahweh he

shall testify of me and I can assure you

that that testimony that the Spirit

gives the Spirit of Truth who abideth

not in the people to make them

understand but to call them and he

speaks through the prophets is when the

spirit of truth today and from some time

ago has made you understand all these

things that is the Spirit of Truth that

is the spirit which is called of

holiness or Holy Spirit that raha Kadesh

it talks of through the prophets he

always talked through the prophets and

ye also shall bear witness because she

hath been with me from the beginning so

then you the disciples will give

testimony how are you gonna give it by

writing by writing what you understand

so then we shall continue study chapter

16 and 17 and other things as well in

the following chapters of the bride of

Yahshua the next one will be the bride

of Yeshua 24 Yahweh Ahad chapter 3 but I

want to leave with you and repeat again

because really everything I studied this

week how the Lord has impressed in my

mind with achieving at least to perceive

a little when he says that he loves us

as much as himself and he is Elohim he

is Elohim and if he loves us who are

nothing in our mind we are nothing in

the mind of the world of science and

that it would seem as if we don't exist

he lives us so much is because he has a

great plan with us with his bride and

no one has greater love than elohim who

placed his life for his bride

it is rather magnificent if you can see

it Alleluia if you find it odd there's

no problem at all but we have one saw

Elohim who all Israel listens to Shema

Israel Yahweh Elohim Yahweh Ahad

alleluia for each and every one of you

as you are let us thank our Lord Elohim

beloved Yahweh thank you because you

speak to us through Scripture but you go

a lot further than that which is written

the spirit of what you wrote we can

understand blessed are thou a way

because you came to earth and you gave

yourself for your friends and clearly

Yahweh we are your friends because we

comprehend this and because we are your

bright and we decide for you to come and

look for us we're waiting for you

because we are prepared and we

comprehend that it is not three not two

it is only you you are our Father you

are our Elohim and you will always be

our husband blessed art thou I ask you

in the name you used with which you came

to earth Yeshua HaMashiach may the Lord

bless you and keep you may you have a

great week but this week is a special

week because we're seven days away

because the Sun is about to set we're

seven days away and we enter in to

shovel odd a day that's very very

special a day in which once we go past

next event a day in which will end

forever the 70th year the 70th sev what

we can wait for the punishment really

once it is fulfilled after next Sunday

then we can expect any type of

punishment at a level that we've never

seen because the 70 have already been

fulfilled in the prophecy of Jeremiah

what's it say when the seventy are

fulfilled they will be fulfilled now 70

chevre what will be fulfilled now may

the Lord bless you greatly may you

comprehend that Yahweh loves us as

himself and that he gave himself for

each and every one of the members who

are his bride may you have a happy and

blessed week
