shabbat shalom lineage of the eternal

truth and France listening and this so

precious and heeded day of Shabbat from

California corresponding to the seventh

day of the fourth month which the Jews

had no better idea than to call it Amos

a Babylonian God the fourth month in the

calendar of Yahweh of the year five

thousand nine hundred eighty seven this

corresponds to the 21st of July of the

year 2018 we shall study yet another

chapter of the bride of the schewe

twenty seven yahwah it had six and we

have a lot more to study in this series

especially yahwah a hot because as we go

into depth and changing certain concepts

and direct them in the true sense of the

scriptures then we must go back to

studying

certain texts so then we shall have a

lot more chapters as you art let us

address our Elohim beloved Yahweh that

art in heaven we give you thanks because

you give us life and the opportunity of

studying your word I ask you Lord that

you bless us on this Shabbat that your

spirit be with us that you forgive our

faults and sins and that you prepare us

for your soon return all this I ask of

you in the precious name of our Savior

and Elohim Yeshua HaMashiach ye sure has

with another year of life the following

members of the eternal truth Mary hey

soos Kalbach Gonzales Spain Alexa Campo

Nicaragua and Eduardo dahveed Brazil

many blessings and made the Lord Yeshua

always accompanied you

proverbs 25:2 it is the glory of Elohim

to conceal the word it is all turned

into a big parable yet it is the honor

of the king to search out the word

amongst the news that I'd like to

mention this week events have taken

place that are rather pretty

attention calling for example it was a

brutal week for our president Trump he

had many visits to many important rulers

for example the Queen of England he

visited some people in the Middle East

and wrapped it all up with Putin all his

enemies came to light which are all the

Democrats and are already certain parts

of his own Republican group and all the

press against him to get things out of

his past and of the rest of them the men

is in hot water with good reason or not

I could care less about but the

political topic is very much moved they

want to remove him as president and

actually they have accused him even of

treason and that being a type of

accusation which is not a light

accusation but comes with a death

penalty if they were to prove that

Russia really intervened in the election

then that would be a death penalty crime

just I understand the weight of it it is

obviously

possible to prove it is impossible to

assure it is all impossible but the

accusations come afloat and are all over

the place they've even asked Putin about

the topic and he says that Russia should

never intervene in blah blah blah and

there are cases tell truth it is a very

special topic I personally don't believe

that there be any cleanliness there

could never be any cleanliness in an

electronic voting system because the one

who has the one who created the program

of the voting he obviously can

manipulate the counting that's obvious

and without leaving a trace

because in countries where there are

millions of people how can they prove

who voted for whom they'd have to ask

each person with a piece of paper who

voted for a home and do an actual count

so then actually the numbers are nothing

but an illusion it's a parable the ones

who win are the ones they want to win so

then if the company and all they had it

programmed for a Hillary Clinton to win

and someone got into the program which

was already dirty because I don't

believe in any clean programs it was

already dirty and stop it off they

hacked that dirty program and they made

that dirty program lose so then of

course what proof can their because not

even the programmers can demonstrate

anything because they would expose how

the program works with the algorithms at

Scott and all that it's like stealing

from a thief it's as if a thief is

robbed and he can't call the cops really

because they would come and find other

stolen articles in this house so it's

the way it is it's all dirty I don't

believe at all in an electronic voting

it is impossible to believe that so then

haven't understood that who knows who

even when the elections who knows who

the people voted for really who knows

but Elohim says that he sets kings and

takes away Kings and that's it we can be

calm about it I am very very calm about

it I don't have any problems with that

but to find dirt on Trump

about past things that is rather a dirty

game a dirty play is what I see it so

then oh well I'm just telling you that

so that you see how revolutionary this

is and I also have been seeing news

about the problems in the countries of

Europe as much as England great problems

England Switzerland France Italy and

other countries in Europe who allowed

the political refugees to go there

refugees from Africa refugees from Syria

and since their countries were at war so

then they brought them by the bunch and

brought them to their countries they did

this as a quote-unquote humanitarian

deed how kind a nation are they saying

come here we offer you a place to stay

poor persecuted people who are homeless

people poor tortured people poor people

that has not even anymore civil or

religious rights in their land something

come and live in our land okay

apparently in everything that I've said

there's no problem people say that is

what modern civilization does that is

what humanitarian values do which are

found in the Bible and the rest well

that I said was all garbage I'm gonna

tell you really what the truth is maybe

the truth hurts for you and you'll say

wow what is Christie insane well I am

seeing what is actually happening and if

you don't believe me they look at the

various of the problems that they've got

nations like England cities and France

Italy and Rome cities which before used

to be very secure clean without any

problems peaceful interesting where

people would go and tell the truth you

would feel great there you'd enjoy

tourism where one would see the

authenticity of

the original culture there now it has

completely changed with the arrival of

the Arabs who destroyed all those of the

Muslim religion that is it's all become

places of terror dirty dangerous and the

culture has even changed neighborhoods

that used to be entirely English Italian

French with people born they're born in

those nations with the culture of those

nations with their businesses for years

hundreds of years there it has all

changed now you see nothing but Arab

signs and that even kanda citizens born

there can even go into those places

because they're kicked out they're not

allowed to film in those places they

closed the doors of the sudden and

there's thousands of Arabs slamming

their faces towards the ground praying

to Allah they shut everything down you

see what happens is the word political

refugees does not really exist did you

know and you're not gonna hear this

anywhere else the word is actually

conquistadors it's like so you can

imagine yourself if you were to live in

a very calm neighborhood where you can

go out of whatever hours of the night

you know all the neighbors you greet

them you take your dog for a walk you

live extremely peacefully and all of a

sudden an African nation or from another

country who don't have anywhere to live

there's a lot of them and they come and

set up camp in your house in your

backyard and if you say I'm gonna be a

good Christian because that's what those

countries are I'm gonna be a good

Christian it's like those countries

allow them into their living room their

living room their living space where

they live or their patio you allow those

people with a good heart to come in

those people rape your children they

change your lifestyle your wife can no

longer walk the dog is all raper both

your dog in her no one's safe and then

they rob you and then kill you southern

all in the name of peace you allow these

political right

Fiji's I'm gonna tell you something of

what I believe as I always tell you

every person must live in their own

country unless they've got enough money

to leave their country and live in

another but when there is a wave of

political refugees that invade another

country all they do is destroy that

country they come with all their customs

or religions bad practices they go to

that country and what have they turned

that country into the same garbage as

the country they left if a country

really wants to help another country in

war they have to go and stop the war and

help them in their country or else is

the same as if you were to bring all the

drug addicts to your house because

you've got a good heart

and you put all your family in danger

well all these countries that were nice

countries of the first world do you know

where they ended up as third world

countries Rome Rome which was a rather

precious city precious in its

architecture history and all the rest

now you'll find in the city squares a

bunch of people bathing naked urinating

defecating in the city squares mind you

and bathing and the pretty fountains

they had there for tourism

oh no it's filled with political

refugees you go to England and now you

go into certain neighborhoods and it's

as if you're in the middle of Arabia

putting up signs saying England is

Muslim in its hours

death to the English live Allah so then

you say wait hold on are these refugees

or what the word is not refugees but

conquista doors the same thing has

happened with El Salvador Mexico and all

who come to the u.s. Los Angeles in

other times and this will hurt those who

are nationalists to the marrow but not

those were not nationalists Los Angeles

was a beautiful clean pretty city until

the arrival of all the Mexicans all the

Salvadorians

are from the rest of the peoples

Argentinians know you'll have to excuse

me but every time in Argentine Ian comes

they don't do all that garbage I have to

say it an Argentinian does not live as

an indigent find me an indigent

Argentinean in the meantime I will show

you all the rest of the indigents and

Argentinian does not stroll across the

border he pays two thousand dollars for

an airplane ticket with visa

Argentinians do not go to Mexico and

cross walking but then let's not mix

things let's not get things mixed up

here how many Argentinian assassin gangs

do you know in LA tell me no not a one

so then there is a difference in the

society there is a difference because

that I know of ms-13 is not Argentinean

Danilo nor the cholos Argentinian how

many Argentinian gangsters Deneuve so

then there are different cultures

completely different cultures an

Argentinian could be a liar fraud

whatever but you'll never see him in

gangs nor as an indigent nor as any

other things that's the way it is now

yes there are good people from El

Salvador there are good Mexican people

there are they're the minority the great

minority that's the truth

so then what happens with those people

they caused a disaster in the country

when I went to study English the

professor said when I was a child my

neighbor would come come into my house

grab some sugar and leave we would never

lock our doors net even from the car we

would leave the keys in the car a white

American told me this once all of you

started to come that's when we started

to lock all our doors we could never

leave the keys in the car it was all

over and he's like your culture ruined

America you can call me racist you can

say whatever I am telling you what I see

with my own eyes if you see something

else if you tell me that the cultures

from El Salvador and Mexican are better

than the American then the American

should invade El Salvador in Mexico if

it's better there but it's the other way

around and that is the problem that

happens in Africa in Muslim land with

the Muslims and that whole bunch that is

the problem and that problem the world

has no solution it has no solution

because there comes a cultural problem

so then poor Muslim folk poor them poor

them poor them we should give him a

house president fed on that the same

thing in Argentina during the best time

in Argentina before getting involved in

war and Argentina would sell wheat and

other grains to all the world they had

so much gold that my professor used to

tell me that the bars would not fit in

the vaults what will go to the national

bank and you had the bars of gold and

the hallways because inside there was no

room it was all filled because the

Germans would buy from them the English

would buy them the whole world would buy

provisions from Argentina we would sell

grain and meat while the rest of the

world were killing each other

Baron said Wow we should progress and

what did paedon do the great president

beloved by all Argentinians who for me

is a complete piece of garbage is all

the other presidents he went to the

borders of Argentina where there was the

least bit of culture and education and

he brought all those people over to

Buenos itís because he needed a

workforce so he burned all those people

who never even knew what it was to live

well nor decently and brought him into a

furnished home completely equipped what

do these people do they stopped working

destroyed the homes and those homes

turned into miserable ghettos and that's

how he ruined Buenos itís because what

the people need is instruction not money

they don't need a space of Refuge they

need instruction that is what they need

tell truth they need instruction so then

when a good person from our countries

comes albeit Argentina Colombia Mexico

El Salvador or Guatemala but with the

best intentions to progress and to

become similar to the culture where

they're going to those people Prague

but when a person comes and all they

want is a little bit of money to send to

their country and the rest spend and

drugs and alcohol what are they gonna do

to their surroundings what do you think

they'll do there are cancer there are

cancer like that of cancer because if

all those people would adapt to the

American lifestyle who actually work and

many people are that way but not

everybody is that way you do follow

right there are many but not all so you

should not feel offended because you

have demonstrated a different level or

else you would be in the gangs and you'd

be in poverty in here there's nobody in

poverty well that's what happens

political refugees do not exist it is

political conquers conquistadors

remember that word conquistadors they

come to conquer the place and when they

conquered they make a barrio this is our

barrio no one's allowed here we run this

and don't you dare take pictures of us

wait hold on a minute

weren't you supposed to be refugees now

they came to conquer it says if you

allow person enter your house they take

over your property they'd have curved

one of your rooms and they say this is

mine absolutely mine they start to put

on music that you've never heard of in

your life he torments you with his music

he starts to smoke in your house he

starts bringing women in and you're like

how do I kick him out you can he's a

refugee poor thing he came from the

street then he raped your daughter your

wife and even you and you have to shut

the hell up because you can't do

anything the refugees and if you speak

against them it's racism anything you

say you're racist if we want equality

these Muslims say we want equality the

only equality with the Muslim is to take

them back to their country lock them up

and not let them out of there the only

way do whatever you want in your country

go ahead and kill one another your

country but don't get out of there

because we don't want anything do with

Muslims nothing to do with them that is

the worst religion that exists in all of

history of all religions are the Muslims

they're the worst I cannot conceive

anything worse bad choose between that

and Paul let me tell her be the first to

become Paul's number one fan

so then those people ruined Africa

Africa was already messed up once the

Muslims entered Africa they left it Wow

I was watching that in Somalia ninety

percent of the girls get their clitoris

removed when they're born why well

because of this wicked religion how do

you think one could judge that culture

how could you judge them this year 2018

for them to mutilate the women how could

you understand that now war breaks out

and all those mutilating sob stake over

your country very well then

that's just in the news so that you see

that in this world there's no justice

and all we can do is to cry out for

justice look if you have not understood

what I said that there is no solution

there's no solution if to cry out for

y'all to come and straighten things out

because from here on out we're already

in a zone we're already in a dark world

but we're about to enter the worst

darkness that you've ever imagined and

once you see it that's when you'll

absolutely believe me today is the 9th

evolve

net in our calendar but in the Jewish

one in the official Jewish calendar

today Shabbat is the 9th of out tisha

b'av

the darkest day in Judaism it was that

day that I told you about where they

said we will not enter Canaan we cannot

enter Canaan they're gonna kill us all

it became the darkest day in Judaism a

whole lot of people died every ninth of

our people would die and then the first

temple was destroyed on the ninth of of

the second temple on the ninth of of and

a lot of disaster suffered by the

Israelite people on the ninth of of

which is called teashop a of even the

AMIA bombing in Argentina which is the

Argentine Israelite mutual Association

building it was bombed on the ninth of

odd precisely killing 85 people and

injuring hundreds I don't the exact

number

careless but it's around there the ninth

of of is a black day so then today many

people expected a black day and actually

Israel is not doing all that well

they're bombing they're being bombed

there's brutal tension there at any

moment something could get triggered and

the Arabs can lose their minds and cause

a massacre I don't know I don't know but

the tension is horrible and today is the

9th of of but a week from now next

Friday

it is to Bev to Bev is the 15th of of

today is the 9th of up for them remember

that for them not for us we have a

different calendar which of the two is

absolutely correct I'll tell to you up

front and right now I do not know I

believe that the one we have is the most

accurate that's what I believe but are

we 100% sure now I not tell you why I

can already see that this study will not

fit into two hours but it's all the

truth about it being sure it is not but

either way that is the one that we

believe or at least I believe that it's

correct so then next Friday there will

be the biggest Blood Moon since the year

2000 to the year 2100 in that cycle it

is the biggest red moon which will last

the longest and over Israel and

precisely on one of their dates to

behave is the day of love it is their

st. Valentine's I've also given this

already in the prior to be shorter Noah

chapter when I explained T sub F and I

explained to Bev to be a vis the day of

love for them it is their st.

Valentine's where they get married if

you want to get married they tell you

the best date is to Bev the 15th of of Y

4 it was the day do you remember the

tribe of Benjamin the ones that were

left could come and choose among the

girls that went out to dance and married

them well that's precisely what to

pelvis and is the day of love the day of

st. Valentine's a Jewish version if you

will

that day they're gonna get the Blood

Moon which has nothing to do with the

day of love or st. Valentine's it would

seem or at least I see it as a

phenomenon that's rather important

assigned in the sky that's extremely

important precisely now that we're in

chef what 71 what I'll take place not or

no what will take place I hope for the

worst but do I know what'll happen I do

not but is it a sign absolutely the

greatest Blood Moon that will exist and

it'll be over is Rael when on to Bev on

the day of love not in the very least

not in the very least they are more than

glad they are organizing because on that

day that day is a special day for them

it is day in which a day in which more

weddings take place it's a special day

so then where though they have a Blood

Moon or not that is the least of their

concerns just an astronomical event I

actually see this as not my chance but

cause and effect with everything we're

seeing for me it is absolutely

meaningful precisely

once Israel has completed 70 years that

Blood Moon over Israel I see it totally

and absolutely meaningful now the sauce

off be meaningful and that just the size

that it will be enormous but the time of

duration

you've got Marsh Mars of which I was

asked this week why do you call it

planet

if he don't believe in planets course I

believe in planets planets the word says

it there wandering stars the planets are

the closest stars to us planets are the

closest stars to us and so then Mars

will be closest to Earth than ever it

looks extremely red if you listen to me

we're not to see it

it is very red and Friday which will be

the 27th day the 27th of July precisely

it'll be redder than ever in the closest

precisely when the blue

Eclipse is produced or the Blood Moon

rather and Mars throughout all history

of humanity it's been considered the God

of War and as it turns out in the Blood

Moon with the God of War the closest

thing to us it'd be nice if a war were

to start there right that'd be very

interesting a combo a combo exactly war

with blood moon and everything that

we've been saying since some time ago

right of what the great tribulation is

tell truth it's impressive very

impressive very well then of a question

that at lectin sir now but first there

is a disclaimer disclaimer a disclaimer

for all the new people and a reminder

for those who have been with this

ministry already from the year 2009

there is nothing

next in what I say what I say today next

rabat or in the following study it could

change why because the eternal truth is

what we are it's what we're looking for

we're in the search of the eternal truth

no eternal truth can be changed no

eternal truth have we changed if we have

changed something is because it was not

an eternal truth and we changed it for

something that is more similar to what

we understand at that point to be true

that is what we have decided not to put

up and take out at some time in the past

we had our beliefs up and we took them

out why because we're in the permanent

search in a permanent search of the

truth that is the word in the permanent

search of the truth and in the permanent

search of the truth when one is willing

to search the truth there are certain

things which once you understanding in a

fresh new way there are certain things

that will clash and you see that have to

be eliminated well before he had as

truth could absolutely change in the

twinkling of an eye as Paul said what

you firmly thought to be true could

change so then I'm telling you this

because there's lots of new people that

tell me but you said this in 2012 but

you set this other thing in 2013 but

even in 2018 they could say there is no

certainty whatsoever and I want you to

know that that's the way it is in this

ministry if you want absolute certainty

for the same things to be preached well

there's a whole lot of churches that

never change a thing and they are not

willing to study to learn anything

what's already been studied a hundred

two hundred years ago is left that way

and it is repeated and you don't you

only study that which is confirmed not

the rest that could be the Adventist

Church other Christian churches it is

already closed they have a book of

doctrines and then removed from the

if that's what you like if that fills

your soul then that's what you should

look for I know that in the psychology

of human beings the last thing you want

nor do I want is to change anything it

is natural we look for a place that's

flat where there is no highs or lows

I want it flat but unfortunately no

angel came from heaven nor did you sure

how mushiya come down from heaven tells

the entire truth of course if an angel

had come or if Yeshua had come he would

sit here and everything he says will be

as so and it's over nobody would argue

with leave the Trinity and in turn to

what is true we'd live into baptism into

what is true when we talk about the

earth in this ministry it used to be a

huge spinning ball that would spin with

time we stopped that ball and the Sun

would go around the ball and then we did

away with the ball in the Flat Earth

showed up which is what it is do you

think that that brings me some sort of

satisfaction no it does not I wish I had

spoken about the earth before and say

the earth is flat once and for all and

that go through that ascending ladder

because every step of the ladder that

takes you upward and you have stepped on

it that step is no longer good because

if you're going up a mountain that

you're not gonna come down from why do

you want that other step it could be

destroyed I would have preferred to

assent to the truth once and for all to

go from believing in a ball and when

they open my mouth the earth is flat wow

that would have been nice once and for

all and not to change not to ever change

do you think I like to change things not

I like to change things

I hate changing things and what I have

to change something I'd take all the

measures in a study really absolutely

everything so that when I say something

it is definite but tell the truth

sometimes what I'm about to say and then

I see that there's a lot more light

about it then I see that there was a lot

more light than what I said so then it's

kind of like the Earth from a spinning

globe to a stopped globe to fly you have

to have

mind open to that or else you cannot

advance with us and you'll feel

completely disappointed because for

example next week we'll be studying a

new impressive interpretation of a

chapter in Scripture which is impressive

so do not miss out on extra bet today

we'll study sing house but actually so

that you see that we've got to be

willing to learn I do lament not having

brought you the purest truth directly

from heaven but I haven't gone up to

heaven and neither have you

much less you so then we're kind of like

those detectives who as we discover new

things we eliminate old ones it is a

truth in movement a truth that actually

changes as it goes so then what we

before thought to be three then we

thought to be two and now we've

understood that it was a parable that of

the tooth that phrase is brutal and

here's the shamash a miser vile yeah

well oh hey no Yahweh I had based on

that base and what we've been studying

we noticed that in Scripture which has

been telling you long time ago in

Scripture what has the most value in all

of this is the Torah or whatever it's

called but that's the way we call it

it's the Torah why the Torah for the

Torah is the most impressive and

astonishing thing in Scripture if you

remove the Torah from Scripture nothing

has value not even revelation because

nothing can prove it everything and the

base of every prophet is the trough

there's nothing else it is not proverbs

it's not songs is not jermiah Isaiah

Daniel much less revelation John Matthew

and even less Mark and Luke the trah is

the most important it is the Tree of

Life the rest is no good if it is not

subject to the Torah and do not change

my words the rest is no good if not

subject to the trough what are the

Christians do they took out the Torah

they completely took out the Torah they

said the trout's been nailed to the

cross and the rest we continue with

what we believe in which is Paul and at

all

exactly occur said if we will go back so

then we having understood all things

Paul another example Paul how many for

how many years that we quote Paul from

in years

innumerable years well we could count

those years I mean we could still count

them but until the year on what year did

we take Paul out 2012 so that in 2009

2010 2011 and even sit doesn't totally

still preach to Paul for how many years

that would preach Paul to later on take

Paul out and to declare him our false

apostle an impostor and a curse it being

things change their completely

absolutely well that's how a lot of

things change but if anything has the

main aim primordial value it is the

trough as I read to you as I explained

in proverbs 30 no one has gone up to

heaven

no one has descended from heaven we

cannot contain the wind in our fists nor

do we know the foundations of the earth

are the extensions of the earth nothing

we have no knowledge about eloheem we

are the most ignorant what the name of

Elohim is nor his sons nothing except

for what is written it says your word

and that about your word is not this

your word don't get confused it's not

your word it's the trough all the

prophets spoke only about what about

Torah your word your Torah is the only

thing that can ever take us to the true

knowledge and to understand who Elohim

is why he created us I curated us why

did we come where did we come from and

where are we going that's what the tries

that's what the prophecy of the seven

days is the most important of them all

seven days of creation with seven

thousand years of plan and that plan is

precisely everything that's written in

the Torah more of that you understand

maybe next your bat but

I wanted to start to understand the

importance of things southern as a

disclaimer to all the new people in as

reminder to all of you here things will

be changing as we discover new light the

things that we really had lights in the

beginning will still shine those things

that we understand that shine more in

this way or that way will be presented

that which is true has not changed

whatever we change because it wasn't

true is the concept I presented

extremely clear ok the Book of Enoch is

completely subject to the Torah in my

opinion the Book of Enoch has no

importance next to the trial tell to you

like that as bold as that Book of Enoch

I love the Book of Enoch I absolutely

love it but compared to the Torah Enoch

is left without value because Enoch does

not teach us the Shabbat Enoch does not

teach us absolutely anything doesn't

teaches the laws Enoch is a

complementary book complimentary to the

tall boy Enoch is the book there

anticipate the coming of exactly it is a

book that announces that the Covenant

will be given but the Book of Enoch is

not the covenant the covenant is in the

Torah that's why it's a book that I take

to be historical a book of which we have

a translation that has gotten to us of

which certain things we don't even know

whether they were added or not but it's

a book I love but it's values nowhere

near the drawers then whatsoever when we

have the Torah as our rule that's all we

have in speaking about that thinking

about that precisely and what I've told

you about the calendar the calendar that

we have which today it tells us that it

is the 7th of the 4th month a lot of

people still writing to me a lot of new

people as well as

old ones who say that we are wrong

because nowhere in the bible does it

speak about a thirteenth month about a

leap year and i'm telling you that is

true there is not one place in all of

scripture the Torah not the rest that

talks about Adar - there is no second

day during the Bible why do we keep it

because we don't we'd be left a month

off tilting like that if we don't keep

it is it in the truck no it's not is it

in the Book of Enoch no it's not and

people are like so vine where in the

bible does it say that there are months

that have 29 days it is also not there

is there text that says that there's a

month that has 29 days there isn't all

the texts say that it has 30 days

because if we were to compare it says

1260 days then it says 42 months if you

divide 1260 by 42 you get 30 and you

always get 30

there's no 29 nor 31 30 so then why do

we have some that are 29 because that is

a way of calculating time if we have

months that are 30 and we have 12 months

of 30 how many days is that 360 we would

run behind and often the dates

no but Enoch says that there are four

days that are intercalated okay four

days intercalated so then we've already

got four days which are ghost ghost days

do I understand it no I don't I don't

understand it am I gonna take it just

like Enoch says tell the truth - no I

cannot take it the way anak says because

I do not understand it he notes is that

every three months there's a day you got

to put in because I don't know why

there's an inter seasonal period or

whatever I can't remember what it's

called now which cannot be recognized as

a day so then zap hear it for Enoch or

for Uriel who told anak about her space

of a full day 24 hours that is not

recognized and we must not calculate it

in the calendar but we have to add it

every three months there is a ghost day

and and that's what they tell me

our they tell me in in tell truth if it

is not logical for me it is not logical

I cannot accept it

they tell me as they send me studies and

studies they tell me okay your your

calendar which is imperfect of 2930 2930

gets to 354 days or whatever and every

soft in every so many years you have to

add another month they say that's not

biblical but what's also not biblical is

that of enoch that of enoch is also not

biblical because they tell us we've got

a perfect calendar 360 since it says 42

months 360 days our calendar is perfect

and i'm like what about the for extra

ghost days they're like oh we don't Adam

okay then also do not add the second

date or don't add it you don't count

four days I won't count the month that's

it look for those four days in the Torah

they're like no it's not there so then

if it's not in the Torah don't in other

words if they cannot prove it they like

but you also can't prove yours but you

can also not call me a heretic neither

you nor iron the Torah I want you to

know that neither of the two are in the

trough so then in Enochs calendar it

says at one day every three months four

days but then you've got to add another

date that it isn't clear but you've got

to add it right because 364 is that

enough for them not enough for them

their day off so then they say and look

at what they say when does the year

begin because Enoch doesn't say when the

year begins there like it does tell you

precisely when it is in the in the when

the Sun crosses precisely halfway that's

the equinox of spring for Israel and for

us the equinox on that day that day must

be the first month the first day of the

first month so then from there it resets

and once the Sun is exactly in the

equinox in the center everything equal

that is where the first day of the first

month begins first day of the first

month

they say that's where the fight begins

amongst those who follow Enochs calendar

some say that has to be a Sunday and

others say no it's gotta be the fourth

date some reset it to Sunday others

reset it to the fourth date and others

don't change the day of the week so then

there are three options every one of

them fights to the death with the others

of those who have the calendar I'm

telling you these options because maybe

you like one of these options and you

choose your path and you must go so then

when we get exactly to the equinox I

know there are many that are listening

to me who know that they've already got

an option to choose and we'll get their

excuses okay so the majority of the

fourth month the fourth date so then

we'll get to the equinox it's Monday

Tuesday Wednesday it'll be a Thursday

that day that'll be a Thursday why don't

ask me Sunday's first no no the majority

I said most of them choose the fourth

day because the Sun was created on the

fourth day since Elohim made the Sun on

the fourth day and placed at exactly

halfway when they get halfway they say

today that we're halfway that's the

fourth day they reset it all the time no

matter if it was Sunday that on previous

day immediately on the Solstice it's the

fourth day and that's where they begin

the first day of the fourth day of the

week fourth day of the week and they

start that way I don't know it's a whole

mess they understand themselves only no

one else others say no it's gotta be a

Monday or Sunday pardon me Sunday the

first day there is the tie truth they

don't convince me whatsoever

I could not present that to you no never

I could not present that to you I prefer

to say let each keep the calendar

they're like you want to follow the

Gregorian when let's continue on with

the Gregorian one they're like no cuz if

you don't keep it the way we say then

you're keeping the feasts wrong and then

the book of the Jubilee switch I

consider it to be a false book let's

talk about that book later and I have

other books that are extremely false and

people see so much value in them in the

book of Jubilees it says that he who

waits and looks for the moon to look for

the beginning of the month that is

paganism

give or take those are the words they

say from Jubilees not quoting word by

word right now but the book at Jubilee

says a that looks for the moon for the

initiation of the month they are did to

paganism something like that give or

take and then they treat us because we

look at the moon as worshippers of the

moon and they say that we're looking for

the moon goddess to mark the beginning

of the month for us now tell the truth

the more I study the calendars I don't

say I don't accept any but I do doubt

the one we have but the only fault I

would say is Elohim if anyone's at fault

here it's Elohim because Elohim didn't

leave us clearly what to follow because

if he would have taken some interest in

leaving us clear what to say he cannot

tell it to me through Enoch he cannot

tell it to me through the Book of

Jubilee which is extremely false he

cannot tell it to me through anything he

had to have left it written in the law I

want to follow the true calendar but the

true one not just because somebody came

and told me oh I found this ghost book

here that tells me how to keep no no the

book of the law is the trial if it's not

there then there's no importance in it

tell it to you like that

and my point of view salvation does not

depend on the calendar because we as I

told you once we keep the but it's got

so many texts I don't want to take up

time on this but this has so many hues

because they say because in heaven and

laymen they're all keeping the Shabbat

and that we nothing but stupidity the

Shabbat only belongs to Earth Shabbat is

not kept in heaven festive days are not

kept in heaven either all that is of man

and for man period the angels don't have

to be celebrating Pesach that's

stupidity but these people that don't

think all that much another one occur

sighs them they miss the cow to hold

onto a mosquito they don't see the cow

but they grab the mosquito and they're

like the mosquito look memorize this in

your minds we keep the Shabbat no matter

at what point in time we decide for it

to be so bad if it's Shabbat it's a bet

and every six days it'll be sure bet I

Sabet coincides with the whole world the

feasts we keep them when we see that the

month begins because now there's also

the theory that the month begins with

the full moon they're like you're all

wrong you don't know the variations out

there they're like you're all wrong it

doesn't begin when you see the moon it

begins when it is full they say the

fifteenth day the day you have is the

fourteenth of the fifteenth that's the

first date so then you've got to look

for the moon and when it's full that'll

be the first day of the month and you're

like better so many theories and yes

that many theories what importance does

the calendar have till truth the way I

see it it's not important because once

you've got a calendar you'll go ahead

and follow the feasts of that calendar

very that's it you'll follow the feasts

of that calendar it's like you with

tides and when it's time to separate the

tides you earn your money and you

separate the tides at some point in time

it doesn't have to be exactly in that

time of the month or when you earn the

money the thing is that you separate the

tides not but you don't give or take

that's the way I see it so then I'm

telling you this because many followers

which are new and people who are seeing

this say I accept everything you say I

love what I've never heard anybody say

things like that but the calendar is not

according to what I understand follow

whatever calendar you want but tell the

truth not even Enoch has any some sort

of logic not anyone has logic not the

one we follow has a lot of logic in it

but that doesn't matter I don't care

actually this calendar works for us if

some day were to see that there's a

calendar better than this I would tell

you no doubt about it no doubt about it

and I dedicate many hours to study what

the rest say to see what light is there

there no one convinces me in the very

least yes and one is how it is decided

how the calendar begins and that's the

moon the moon the Sun and the stars

three things not just one thing the moon

to some stars exactly but they may have

some sort of pattern and it has to show

up on that day and it's got to be seen

but two witnesses no

where on earth that is seen in that

you've had to buy you sure exactly but

we don't have a text for that that's

what I'm arguing there's not a text in

the Bible if somebody if I had a text

that would say and pay attention when

the moon shows up

you shall begin the month there's not a

text for that not one not a one not even

one

but there are some texts that say that

the man's song yeah but from it being

assigned to telling you look for the

first moon as soon as you see the first

line there isn't there isn't there isn't

just like that parrot there isn't what

is me no matter what it's subject to

we're talking whether there are laws no

there is no law spared no laws there is

no laws and Enoch will not be my law I

declare it my law is the Torah my laws

dattara period Enoch is not my law Enoch

does not give me laws enough what he

gave me is uh kind of like a historical

view of what was to happen but Enoch was

not sent to give laws cuz Enoch didn't

show me the Shabbat he didn't show me

how to keep the Shabbat nor how to keep

it nor any of that that he teach me

Enoch didn't teach me the feasts so then

when we talk about actually the laws

that rule our life we have to clearly

understand which are those laws that

rule our lives it's the trial period

Torah absolutely the trough so then we

make a brutal air when we say yeah I'm

gonna put the Torah site in the Book of

Enoch teaches me this I'm gonna follow

what the Book of Enoch says alright the

book of Jubilees the book of Jubilees

I'm gonna follow what the book of

Jubilees says or the book of Melchizedek

war added what could Melchizedek if he

will or the book of the Ascension of

Isaiah I'll follow what the book of the

Ascension of Isaiah says or the book of

Ezra is for I'm gonna follow what the

book of Ezra for says so then out of

those books I grab little pieces and I

make my law so then why do you want the

trough or tell me what do you want the

Torah for there are many factors for

example every time that in the Tanakh it

says the new moon you see the new moon

it actually doesn't say the new moon it

says the beginning of the month

just that they have translated it as the

new moon because I know that you're

gonna find in say a it says the new moon

here it doesn't say the new moon it says

the beginning of the month but it is not

clear when the month begins

if Elohim would have cared a bit for us

to not be wrong in the beginning of the

month he should have left the law

clearly where the law should be found in

the law I want you understand it I'm a

person that's hyper ly orderly if Yahweh

tells me I'm gonna give you laws but all

of them separated throughout the

prophets no no no that's what he gave me

a book of laws prophets give me prophecy

but in the book of the laws in the book

of instruction you have to give me all

your laws

I can't discover some book somewhere

around there that was lost and it gives

me a law and now that law rules my life

now that can't be that could never be

it's either in the book of the law or

you don't care that I have it do you

understand that so then if Yahweh did

not care for me to clearly understand

when that month begins yeah I was

telling me deal with it but once you

have the calendar keep my sabbaths out

of your calendar out of your calendar

just like out of your earnings you take

the tides notice cuz if I don't know

it's not about whether I earn out of

your salary from what I give you give me

the tides so then he gives this calendar

keep what this calendar says that is all

that I see there is no sin when

something is that explicit in the trough

are you understanding because then I

find some other blasphemous book that

says to get married is a sin and that's

it now exactly how many loves that Paul

cave tell me how many plots that Paul

cave they have no value those laws

that's why I've told you I don't want to

give you laws I don't want to give you

laws because the laws are in the Torah I

can try to explain what the law says or

try to explain what the prophecies say

but I cannot give you a new law do you

follow that is what people are always

looking for new laws new laws but don't

think for a minute that I don't study

other calendars this week I studied a

whole lot of calendars one worse than

the next

just like that one worse than the next

they give me a stomachache like the

lunar Shabbat but it's just that the

lunar tschappat seems to be nice because

it's just right of course if you were

lost in an island and you don't know

what day it is you will already know

what the moon because once you see the

moon the first day it's not a ship at

but the first day is a special day kind

of like a Shabbat but it's not a weekly

Shabbat count seven days or six days and

in the eighth one on the eighth month

the eighth one that'll be Shabbat the

eighth one the fifteenth in the twenty

seconds in the 29th our sebat you can

kick back you've got your calendar and

all that you're like huh nice tell the

truth if there isn't anybody or

information

yeah which shows us in heaven when it's

Shabbat that is a lie just like that a

lie a lie if Allah were so it should

have been written in Scripture yes or no

but the scripture says six days shalt

thou labor and do all thy work but on

the seventh that's where you break that

law cuz then there comes a day that

moves your whole week and then it moves

the week again so then there is a time

in which you do not keep that

commandment but rather he obliges you to

rest just like in the calendar of Enoch

ridiculous well what a strong thing to

say

yeah ridiculous when an angel comes and

he tells me look you've got so many days

they add another day and don't count it

in the calendar but you can't count the

day in the calendar but it's a ghost day

and then they say and men shall err

because they don't follow this calendar

men shall are and their sin will be on a

hold on a moment I'm gonna be destroyed

because I couldn't find the true

calendar I don't know we're gonna talk

with Elaine why didn't you leave it very

clear in the law I would like for Elohim

to come today and tell us the calendar

is kept like this but Elohim not just

any idiot to come tell me Elohim you see

because you tell me who of us would be

against it a fellow he would come and

give us a new calendar no one absolutely

no one and we would understand it but

from that to have somebody to come and

change our calendar when there is no

logic whatsoever in it

I perfectly know that there's no

thirteenth month I perfectly know that

the bible does not teach when the month

begins i know i perfectly know it but we

find a way so that we can really have a

way of keeping those feasts because all

we care about is to keep those feasts

because we're actually of course we are

actually ruled by the gregorian calendar

from Sunday to Friday Gregorian calendar

so then we keep the Shabbat and we keep

the feasts what is Yahweh's calendar

good for it basically just to identify

where the feasts are basically that is

basically what we needed for it I've

already told you this once in authority

again if in our understanding the feasts

do not coincide with what was actually

in the beginning that doesn't matter

because I don't know best concept of

things we are keeping those feasts in

the appropriate calendar there's no

place where it says this is the specific

day which not because that corresponds

to men in heaven they don't keep the

feasts that is only you should have said

it the Shabbat was made because of men

and for men so then how did these

Apocrypha books and say in heaven they

keep the Shabbat it's all a lie as soon

as I read a phrase like that that book

is good to be burnt till - like that

burn it

I'll go ahead and read some apocryphal

books to you because tells you how the

people I think that there is a lot of

need of the truth that they have turned

into the apocryphal books to try to find

and there's so much garbage but they eat

that garbage do you know what the deal

is with the apocryphal books do you know

how I find out an apocryphal book the

first thing I discover I'll tell you

which is the first thing I the first

thing I discover when they mention

Yeshua when they mention that you sure

shall come like the book of Melchizedek

an entire garbage because in the book of

Melchizedek it says somebody will come

whose name is Yeshua and he's gonna die

for the people on a whole done if Isaiah

spoke everything in parables and these

people come with the entire understand

this if they speak about you assuring

about his death and about his 12

disciples that was written by a

Christian after the

fact that it's happened and he wrote it

to have fun using using the truth which

exists but he went back in time and he

made up a huge profit don't follow that

trap don't fall in it elohim didn't

leave absolutely any book would say that

he was gonna come with his twelve

disciples and that he was gonna be

persecuted and he would die and

resurrect explicitly like that he left

everything in parables but then he's not

gonna send some other idiot to write

everything explicitly in the Christian

version of how everything would happen

but if the important prophets left it in

parables how are they gonna send someone

else

with everything explicitly so then that

some idiot Christian read systems are

like oh how much wisdom there is here

this book well and those books are the

ones that give you the calendars and in

those books are what actually confuse

the people those who give you certain

truth and you think that they were

written before you sure came so then of

course it takes a lot more value than

Jeremiah Isaiah it takes a lot more

value than even the trough because those

books they tell you and you shall come

they're like yeah sure we'll come we'll

descend from the seventh heaven and he's

gonna die I know and you say how could

you be such an idiot to believe that how

could it be I know it's incredible but

we'll study those books because tell

truth this week I was reading some very

interesting books look I could even

write I could I could write a book

that's it that you'll if you don't know

and then I'll sign it as I don't know at

the Daiya for I've found a book of

Obadiah for and I'll write up even up

until today's history and I'll be like

what vision of ayodhya he saw Hitler saw

Obama saw Trump saw it all so then

they're like this is marvelous

this is dumb be idiots don't be naive

don't be so naive and Lehane gave us

this book this book which already has

things that are absolutely false but he

gave us the major prophets the Torah the

Torah indicates you exactly the time

that this world has and he does not need

any other prophet to come and tell you

how you chose to come exactly look

the moment that I read I remember what

buck if the Book of Daniel or some of

those that are linked him and said I

will sometime in the future come and

dive free already falls right there in

that point it's already false because

that law team doesn't speak like that

how does it mean speak in parables when

you see something explicit that is not

explicit in Scripture it is false but

you surely have that rule it's false

you're not discovering gunpowder it's

already been discovered it is not gold

it is false it's just a regular Rock

painted gold and you swallow it entirely

thinking you've discovered all that gold

there is no gold there if somebody sees

written nuttin parables but directly

it's false like that it's false it's

false

[Music]

exactly exactly so then I do want to

read some books to you just to have fun

just so that you know because maybe

there are some of you who want those

books and maybe you say oh this is the

truth and you go with that truth we've

got a couple books to read there that's

what when I read to you

Jubilees entirely false just like that

from the moment in which Jubilees starts

off with I am the angel Gabriel I think

it was Gabriel who stayed with Moses and

dictated these words I don't know we

already started off wrong that the

authorizes withdraw completely either I

have the book of Jubilees or I have the

trial one of the two mine too

don't think that the book of the two

beliefs is a complement of the Torah no

that is a lie

it's either the book of Jubilees with

the book of Torah what do you want but

their desire

I'll throw everything away I'll keep the

traW just like that I absolutely keep

the Torah very well then

and what is the tras a scheme'

Israel Yahweh Elohim Yahweh a had we've

got one Saul Elohim and what does Isaiah

say Isaiah 46 8 through 13 the martini

toe remember this and understand it well

enter into reason ye sinners remember

the days of old that I am Elohim a mini

Elohim

I am NOT we are I am and now other

Elohim exists and there is none like

unto me or in the beginning I announce

the end since when does he announce it

this is the beginning since that is she

and from beforehand where has not yet

happened I say my decision is carried

out and everything that I please I

execute from the Orient I call the Eagle

from a far country the man that I've

designated as I say they do it

I say planet I execute it hearken unto

me ye stout-hearted either afar from

righteousness now is my righteousness it

is not far off my salvation will not

tarry and I hope so

soon I will give my salvation to Zion

and my glory unto is Rael Jeremih 16 19

through 21 Spanish knock our Colunga

Yahweh who Yahweh the only Elohim that

exists Yahweh my strength and my

fortress my refuge in the day of

tribulation until each of the peoples

come from the ends of the earth and say

only large was the inheritance of our

fathers what was the inheritance of our

fathers what did we inherit only lies

vanity in which there is no avail and

vanity do you know what word that is

heaven in heaven is let's have a vanity

or bow nutball that we have ball with no

avail I was what NASA were all

continuing if there is man making

himself the gods then those are not gods

obviously therefore behold I will this

once cause them to know I will cause

them to know mine hand in my might and

they shall know that my name is Yahweh I

was looking at some news from NASA I

don't know if it was old or what how do

you say Buddha no in English okay Uranus

NASA published your anus stinks awfully

bad like rotten

eggs a scientific article mind you but

the question is at what level are these

folks laughing at the people Uranus is

the same as if to say your anus your

anus that's what they named the planet

Uranus smells bad

Uranus stinks bad I mean it's gotten to

a point where they're mocking the people

they're like your anus stinks bad like

rotten eggs people read that article and

they believe it and they're like because

of gases and of the idiotic explanation

that people just swallow into a level

that's completely idiotic but Wow

I had not noticed that Uranus I had

noticed that Uranus stinks bad smells

bad yeah I'd like to know wanted to go

to smell it it must be that NASA's anus

stinks bad we can assure that NASA's

anus stinks bad very bad

because actually wow if people would

only wake up I'll tell you what if

people would actually wake up to the

Flat Earth as it is it would cause a

great Civil War because of olive the US

and I'm just talking about this country

which has a higher acquiring power than

the rest if all the Americans would say

it's true the earth is flat the next

article would read a true thought they'd

lie to us and all those things they

showed us they lied to us and that we

went to the moon they lied to us and the

satellites the lied to us and the

voyages they lie to us wait and all the

money we gave them they'd lie to us do

you know what NASA is not a private

entity of some guy it is of the US

government so then who lied to us the

u.s. does the u.s. deserve first to give

them our taxes zero not just that we're

gonna throw into prison the entire US

Congress because if as it turns out the

press

has actions in AT&T and DirecTV do they

note that the satellites exist or not of

course they know they shows this face

they are thieves if the people would

wake up not one politician could be left

standing the next thing is the bloodiest

Civil War II could have ever imagined

there is no possible solution because if

the people say how am I going to pay my

taxes to these guys all that it deserves

is for us to go and set everything on

fire the entire government from the

President to the very last wretched

politician throw them in jail and they

have to give us the money back and we

want explanations if this would happen

in every country

can you imagine what chaos this would be

it would only take for our people to

wake up for a hate to awaken due to

deceit it's not just any deceit it is

hating deceit all the billions and

trillions of dollars that NASA aid up

that they stole where are they the

politicians have it they have them to

govern it would take for every citizen

to awaken and when they do civil war if

they would awaken let's start there

let's start there there's a big if if

but they are so programmed but I will

tell you this once old person that wakes

up to the Flat Earth never goes back to

the globe he can't he loves he sees the

things of NASA everything floating the

cables and it causes your laugh

aside from the hate makes you laugh yes

it's their anniversary today's the 20th

of July other 21st the 20th they got on

the moon one of the two okay one of the

two it depends on what side of the earth

you were they say but but I mean it's

just so hilarious it's cuz guile deceit

that light is not an innocent lie it is

a lie that has trillions of dollars

behind it wicked bet which is talking

about money it's money the government

has to return that money back to the

nation which they stole first thing you

say is not gonna

pay any more taxes ever for no one - can

you imagine the type of war here that

the military would wake up to the deceit

and say hold on for the military to be

divided from within we're not talking

about just the citizens waking up for

all of them to wake up poor politicians

poor NASA it depends on the lane a few

more should wake up

they say I'm telling you there was a

news that in October there was a group

of a group of scientists who say that

they will make the world known that the

earth is completely flat I don't know if

that's true I don't know but I read it

yes in the army in the Navy and he flies

planes and I asked them when you're on

the air do you have to keep tipping the

nose down you tip the airplanes nose

down or is it straight or do you see the

curvature and here he sees where I'm

headed but since he has instructions

obviously there's instructions they

cannot see it but the pilots sign a

contract I didn't know this they cannot

speak did you know that all the flights

are they are controlled by NASA the NASA

is an organization well they control

every flight anything that has to do

with aeronautics both civil and

transportation all of it

Nessun has to confirm your route do you

see any control on that yeah it is

rather impressive tell truth it is

impressive it would take the entire

world to wake up to say the only thing

they deserve is death because there is

there is no possible pardon there is no

possible excuse it is all controlled and

approved by them they cannot change the

route of a flight if it's not approved

by NASA as to it is from birth the first

thing to give you is a ball they stick

that ball into your head and they show

you that they indoctrinate you from

childhood and the free education they

call the education that's free for

it is an entire indoctrination which is

not free but it is very costly it is

very costly it costs absolutely

everything very well then

southern only lies was the inheritance

of our fathers last tschappat and I had

to touch on the subject again last

Shabbat we studied something marvelous

which is found in Psalms chapter 2 which

talks about precisely

I shall declare the decree yahwah has

told me you are my son i have begotten

you today before last shebat every one

of us as the eternal truth we had

understood and accepted that it was

speaking about Yahweh the father with

yahwah his son per se or eloheem the

father will owe him the son I've got the

father we've got the son so you

understand but why did the eternal truth

have that interpretation what is the

reason did we make it up no it's the

inheritance of our fathers that is what

you call direct inheritance of our

fathers why because all the Christians

all the Christians accept that Psalms 2

talks about God the Father and Jesus

I'll say like that cuz that's what they

say it Jesus there isn't even the very

least variation all the Christians and

did you know for what reason do you know

for what reason and I don't need to read

you any quotes from Ellen G wide or

quotes from other pastors or their

denominations because all unanimously

accept that Psalms 2 talks about God the

Father and Jesus for what reason do you

know for what reason because there are

certain biblical writers who apply it so

then if I accept all this as the Word of

God that is already been inculcated and

instructed and placed as an absolute

truth who speaks about that who speaks

about that who are the writers who have

already interpreted Psalms 2 for me

that's why all the Christians without

exception understand that God and his

son

now I understood that shebat I taught

that it's not God in his son and not

very least its first of all yahwah and

david and that would be in what is

literal and symbolically which is more

important it is Yahweh and Israel and

actually the hundred forty four thousand

kings that is what we have to understand

in it is clear no one understands that

absolutely no one absolutely no one now

who speaks about this let us go to Paul

sermon the servant of Paul of Tarsus in

acts 13 X 13 I had to read it to you so

that you understand why we have changed

something we thought that was an eternal

truth and it was an eternal I inherited

of our fathers that's why I have to

change it no matter how much it costs us

about of a stomachache it gives us

because I know that many people of you

have left not many people from you

because they've already loved many

people who were with us I've left

because you got dizzy with the ups and

downs one day that way one day this way

and they're like I can't take this

anymore I can't take this I don't even

know what I believe I'm out of here they

say I'll go with the Indians I'll go

with great chief captain the horse or

Wade whomever of with great pastor

Gambetta or with whatever I go but I can

no longer take for them to tell me one

thing today and tomorrow something else

well unfortunately since we have

inherited how much lies from our fathers

all of it all of it everything that we

inherited was a lie

little by little were taken up the lies

okay then that's why issues guiding us

to where he wants us to go exactly and

we have to go like that I know that in

the inertia of the movement we're going

to lose some people that are not hold

fast this is like a coaster ride if you

have not held fast to the wagon you're

gonna be shut out you have to hold fast

to that which you believe to be true I

love that picture you put on there

Leslie of the soccer ball it's

spectacular please share it on my wall

again

was new who was it new it's all new here

with the football soccer ball exactly

did you see how at least some of the

things I say are fulfilled I said

friends would be champion I didn't say

it on the air but I told you there are

my witnesses that France would be

champion and France turned out to be the

champion did they deserve it I don't

know but the first two goals weren't

valid the first one was a fault that was

our fault and from them a center came in

and made a self goal so weird extremely

weird and the other one was not a

penalty because if they say that's a

penalty they have to have 10,000 other

penalties it was not a penalty and I'll

explain why in this nauseous football

I'll explain because the player was not

looking at the ball in when he turns his

arm separates a little bit and there

precisely with the velocity of the ball

he's not even trying to stop it that's

what you call a non intentional hand

there was no intention of the player of

touching it with the hand that's not a

penalty anywhere in the world but this

Argentinian arbiter you see perfect not

just them perfect their corrupt but to

be corrupt is one thing and gangs is

another it's something else

Argentinians are extremely corrupt

there's a reason why they chose our

corrupt Argentinian that's what we have

an Argentinian Pope you see what I'm

saying

an Argentinian Pope an Argentinian

corrupt arbiter an Argentinian and he's

his penalty although he saw it he saw

the play that was not a penalty anywhere

in the world no no but the rule the rule

the ruling in football reads as follows

and listen if you don't know the

football rule says you have to consider

the intention of the player of touching

the ball with the hand but it's not the

players intention and he's turning if I

point this way and if there's no

intention you can it and if he's got his

back turned you cannot call it a penalty

as to it is it really is that way he

didn't follow the rule any operator can

tell you it was not a penalty a hand

does not mean penalty there has to be an

intention with the hem

it wasn't stuck I don't know no no

doesn't matter it doesn't matter the

hand can be right there has to be

intention that is what the rule says I'm

not saying it now the penalty they

charged on pick a guy was thrown on the

ground while tucson's hand didn't they

call the penalty if he and if he with

the hint tries to touch the ball whether

he's in the ground or not the arbiter

has to evaluate the intention that's why

I'm not trying to argue didn't elope

the rule says the rule says it is a hand

when there's intention to play with the

hand no matter if it's separate or stuck

to the body it doesn't matter for its

separated if there's an intention

playing with the hand if there's no

intention and playing with the hand it's

not a penalty that's what the rule says

at football clearly there was no

intention of the player anybody can tell

you even the best arbiters can tell you

that that was not a penalty the

Argentinian arbiter made up the penalty

France attacked twice two goals that's

how they started off and of course then

they scored another two and it became

too difficult for Croatia but what am I

trying to show with this the game was

arranged the game has been arranged

since long before it starts way before

they had to win they chose that arbiter

who's gonna charge whatever pass the way

this as to it is so then I ask you you

did think that that was a penalty right

in your point of view anything that hits

the hand is a penalty are you see the

rule says no no no that's not though it

is the rule doesn't say that if the rule

were to say an outstretched hand is

always a penalty than yes but that's not

what the rule says the rule says that

there has to be an intention of playing

the hint that's what the rule says the

violence of the ball has this end to go

like that

okay you see all football does cause

polemics that's all football does

polemics

but either way but either way it was

fulfilled what I told you or not are you

see France won a complete piece of

garbage the entire Cup I really have to

say it

piece of

garbage just to raise his star to raise

a star and to kiss her if you saw the

video I put up a picture of the Cup won

by Palais those are called the jewelry

mint right that was already the goddess

directly you see how if you look at the

cup it was the goddess directly with

wings and all they changed that cup and

they put up the cup where they put the

ball now to continue to program us the

round globe and if star was a little

more disguised but it's the same garbage

I put up the photos Oz look him up

online look him up online an entire

piece of garbage southern let's go to

Paul sermon what does Paul say in acts

13 26 through 39 men and brethren he's

speaking to Israelites before going to

the Gentiles right men and brethren

children of the stock of Abraham and

whosoever among you feareth elohim to

you is the word of salvation sent for

those who live in jerusalem and their

rulers not having known you schewe nor

the words of the prophets which are read

every Shabbat fulfilled them by

condemning him Paul always adds some

truth or else they would not believe him

and though they found in him no guilt

worthy of death

they asked Pilate to have him executed

and when they had carried out all that

was written of him they took him down

from the tree and laid him in a tomb up

until now we're doing all right

we're doing all right and here begins

what I understand to be alive that some

may say well you can interpret it okay

but eloheem raised him from the dead we

could interpret Elohim that it's his

divine part raised from the dead

the human part we could interpret I can

already see it as in a way that I really

don't like

cuz he's Elohim the father Paul sees the

father Yahweh when it says God Paul

never said because Yahweh's issue ax he

didn't say that

31 and for many days he appeared to

those who had come up with him from

Galilee to Jerusalem who are now his

witnesses to the people and we also

announcement to you the good news of

that promise made to our fathers which

Elohim has fulfilled to us their

children by raising Yeshua right there

we start seeing this topic to get a

little more grave Elohim fulfilled unto

the Israelites by raising Yeshua as also

it is written in the second Psalm my son

art thou this they have I begotten thee

Paul interprets that Psalms 2 refers to

Elohim in the son DC that's why

Christians have no other option other

than to interpret that Psalms 2 talks

about the father and the son or else

that would have to go against their

father Paul so then when we interpreted

as they interpret it then it's not that

it was something we came up with but

rather the Christian scriptures

themselves thus though L say it

Christian scriptures it's already

interpreted for us Paul is saying that

this was fulfilled precisely in the

resurrection in fact I've heard

Adventist sermons of pastors who are

obviously defending the Trinity and they

say do you see that in Psalms 2 that

talks about elohim and his son it is not

saying that the son is begotten as we

would say using that text before but

what he sends that he begat him when he

resurrected him because notice how Paul

puts it I want you to understand that

Paul is putting this has been that in

resurrection that's when he begat him

when he resurrected him he begat him

that's what Paul saying I'll read it

again

he says God hath

filled the same unto us their children

in that he had raised up Yeshua when

what in that Elohim raised up Yeshua as

it is also written in the second Psalm

thou art my son this day have I begotten

thee so then so then Paul interprets

that psalms two is fulfilled in the

resurrection that it's got nothin to do

with him being begotten before creation

but being begotten at the resurrection

and I have heard Adventist pastor saying

you see how ridiculous it is for these

people saying that the issue has

begotten if here the Bible who

interprets itself is saying that he was

begotten when he was resurrected Paul in

the Bible called being begotten to be

resurrected and that's it and how could

you fight against this if Paul the

greatest of the Apostles is telling you

this who can move them from their 34

says and as concerning that he raised

him up from the dead now no more to

return to corruption he said on this

wise I will give you the sure mercies of

David wherefore he saith also in another

Psalm thou shalt not suffer thine Holy

One to see corruption

okay the interpretation of Paul was

already absolutely incorrect completely

incorrect he misapplied a text he gave

it a pernicious interpretation in the

resurrection called that to be begotten

and he said that and Elohim the father

resurrected another and he said I have

begotten thee today now he continues in

the bad interpretation and this one

actually I think that some of us still

have it Paul says that the fulfillment

of Psalms 16 is found in the

resurrection of Yeshua you see how he

just said thou shalt not suffer thine

Holy One to see corruption we're about

to read with Psalm says for truly David

after he had served his own generation

by the will of Allah he fell on sleep

and was laid into his father's in saw

corruption paul says but he whom

he is Yeshua whom elohim raised again

saw no corruption why does Paul say that

he saw no corruption that's interesting

because you sure was three days and

three nights in the tomb that's

difficult to not see corruption for me

there's corruption as soon as you die

ten minutes after you die there's

corruption the cells are dead the

corruption starts immediately 24 hours

there's an immediate corruption why does

Paul dare to say that he saw no

corruption because it's misaligned very

badly and a psalm that has nothing to do

with that he is completely miss applying

it he heard it misapplied psalms 2 and

now he's misapplying psalm 16 which I'm

about to read to you so delete from your

mind that Yeshua saw no corruption

deleted how many had that engraved until

today everyone everyone everyone and why

everyone because Paul interpreted it for

you who interpreted it for you Paul did

Paul interpreted it for you 38 says be

it known unto you therefore men and

brethren that through this man is

preached unto you the forgiveness of

sins and by him all that believe are

justified from all things from which he

could not be justified by the law of

Moses and here begins the first hack

attack against the Torah by him are

justified all that believe a complete

Pauline doctrine the law of Moses is no

good for you it cannot justify you the

only thing that can justify you is this

being raised by Elohim that's what he

says this being raised by Elohim whom he

had begotten because he raised them he

was not raised he was raised by Lehane

and that Bain was begotten at the moment

of resurrection and he also did not

leave him in the tomb so as to not see

corruption it is all wrong let's go to

Psalm Psalm 16 I'll go ahead and read

from 7 through 11 so you get the whole

context I'll read from Jerusalem 2001

Psalms

sixteen 7 through 11 david says i bless

yo way who gives me counsel i ask if

that's the issue speaking yeshua blesses

yahwah who cancels him ok

David speaking I bless y'all way who

gives me counsel even at night he

instructs my conscience I have set

Yahweh always before me with him to my

right hand I shall not be shaken

therefore my heart is glad and my whole

being rejoices my flesh also dwell

secure for you will not abandon my soul

to share nor let your friend see

corruption question what does this have

anything to do with Yeshua as you sure

the friend of Yahweh did Yahweh

resurrect you sure

so then who is Yeshua who then is Yeshua

here

David clearly says that he will not

allow him see the pit for you will not

abandon my soul to show or let your

friend see the pit now why does he say

that's what my heart rejoices why

because what I understand that David

says is that he won't leave him dead

forever that's what David saying will he

die yes he will evidently he died but

David a sane you will not leave my soul

in shell forever that is what he's

saying he's not saying I will not see

corruption it is a figure of speech what

David is saying is I am calm because

even if I die I know that one day you

will resurrect me that is what he's

saying that is the only thing saying 11

you will show me the path of life in

your presence there is fullness of joy

at your right hand are pleasures forever

more in other words David is talking

about that even if he dies someday when

he resurrects him he will make him full

or fill him with joy in the presence of

yahwah and of perpetual joy at the right

hand of Yahweh that's what David is

saying Paul took this and he said this

does not belong to David it belongs to

the issuer it is you shall not see your

Holy One see corruption do you see the

David died of course David saw

corruption but there won't be corruption

forever

that is what David is saying you will

not allow my body to be left in

corruption forever take out of your head

that interpretation because that

interpretation was given by Paul every

time that comes to mind to remember I

shall not see my Holy One see corruption

who said that Paul who said that Paul so

then he already interpreted Psalms 2

incorrectly in extremely incorrectly

Psalm 16 and of course the entire

Christianity took this interpretation as

an absolute truth all of Christendom

okay we've already got now thir I've

already got an author that speaks about

Psalms 2 equivocally

and that is why all of Christendom

believes that that's why we used to

believe that now let's go to Hebrews

which I don't know who wrote it at one

time I said that it was written possibly

by Peter

so truth I don't know I pretty much want

to remove that said I'm saying I pretty

much want to remove that because I find

Hebrews to be pretty garbagey what I say

pretty much garbage I don't want to say

about Hebrews take it out of the Bible

and burn it but it's pretty close it's

like that I've had to choose between

value not value I would give no value to

the book of Hebrews but why because I

will read now and you will make a

judgment Hebrews 1:1 through six Spanish

RV 1960 comparable to the King James

Version reads as follows

Elohim when we read Elohim it's Yahweh

we all agree right ok when an author

writes Elohim he refers to Yahweh we

could read Yahweh our Elohim having

spoke

at sundry times and in divers manners in

other times to the father's by the

prophets so far we're perfect in these

last days had spoken unto us by his son

if I stop there that's fine because we

interpret it within the parable yahwah

spoke to the prophets pardon me to the

fathers through the prophets and now you

always speak sister to the son that's

fine if i understand that the son and

yahwah are the same person it's a

parable but it continues whom he hath

appointed heir of all things hold on

there it's no longer a parable that

Yahweh appointed as an heir the son then

this can no longer be read as a parable

do you follow there were clearly seen

two different people whom he hath

appointed heir of all things and by whom

also made the universe now now worse

because it says Yahweh made his son the

heir of all things and also created the

entire universe because of the Sun on a

whole done then then what Yeshua said

that he was Yahweh it goes direct into

the garbage can because then Yahweh made

the universe through the son for her son

that has no sense whatsoever in the

parable of the father and the son

yahwah made the universe for him for

Yahweh not for not for the son but for

Yahweh now that Yahweh showed up in the

world with the form of a son that's one

thing because evidently he could not

show up in the form of Yahweh because he

would not have completed his mission but

already for an author that supposedly

inspired to start to say what he sane I

see it as complete garbage yeah we did

not make the universe for a son Yahweh

did not make his son heir of all things

that is completely unacceptable are you

understanding this or not okay three

it continues whoo the Sun is speaking of

the Sun he's speaking not the Sun but of

the Sun who the son of Yahweh being the

brightness of his glory in the Express

image of his substance ears tell me that

they are two people completely separate

and one is the image of the other that

the Sun is the image of the father and

the son is the heir of everything of the

Father DC so then I'll continue to read

or I'll read again who the son being the

brightness of his glory and the Express

image of his person and upholding all

things by the word of his power

having made effective the purification

of our sins by himself

sat down on the right hand of the

Majesty on high the word on the right

hand I shall explain later on when I

present the other topics have to present

at the right hand for being made so much

better than the Angels as he hath by

inheritance obtained a more excellent

name than they okay the text has now

become an actual blasphemy it is not

garbage now it is blasphemy he's saying

that the son of Yahweh was made so much

better than the Angels he's no longer

talking about Yahweh he's not talking

about a parable between the father and

the son he's talking about a being that

it is completely aside from Yahweh do

you see this completely foreign and not

just that but he says that he was made

so much superior to the Angels he cannot

say that because the angels not even

superior to the humans the guy saying

this is extremely ignorant it's a guy

did not understand that humans are right

after Yahweh so then being made so much

better

the Angels as the name he has inherited

is more excellent than fares that's why

he inherited the name of Elohim

that's where we many times said you see

that yeah sure

Venus is the son of Yahweh also has the

name of Yahweh he's y'all with the Sun

yah with the father yah with the Sun

Elohim father LM the Sun God the Father

got the Sun cuz he inherited the name of

Elohim this is entirely a blasphemy

everything I've just read is complete

garbage and has nothing to do with the

Shema how can you reconcile this with

the Shama it's impossible it is

impossible this already this separates

itself from the parable already

completely separates itself and makes a

new doctrine a doctrine of two people

but in turn the father is the most

important you see that very well then

and he continues some of the garbage for

to which of the Angels that Elohim who

is Yahweh ever say my son art thou today

I have begotten thee and we go back to

what Paul said about psalms - so then do

you see that the author of Hebrews

coincides with Paul in what in the

interpretation of Psalms - possibly

I don't know it might be the same author

so much for me saying that it was in

Paul because he didn't sign it well they

coincide precisely they coincide

precisely in the same thought this is a

thought this is an interpretation that

is completely equivocal and after saying

the rubbish she said here then this

author explains for to which of the

Angels that Elohim ever say you are my

son today I have begotten you or again I

will be to him a father and he shall be

to me a son and again when he brings the

firstborn into the world the first born

into the world he says worship Him all

the angels of God

so then clearly we see two people here

one when he introduces him and yahwah

the father tells the angels worshiped

what i'm introducing there you see how

there's a grave problem here the angels

didn't know that that was y'all within

but this author says that that was

Yahweh that was the image of the

substance and it's the son who is the

heir of all things and by whom he made

the universe and that he's the son

southern here we've got precisely and

what I see a doctrine that is completely

foreign to what we believe if that's how

the belief starts off if that's how the

book starts off this is complete garbage

and in Chapter two the garbage continues

the garbage continues but if that's how

the book starts off how much value is

there in the rest of the book but let's

go to chapter five some must already be

shocked you had said we already had

Hebrews as a historical book right right

and now from historical book to garbage

and went down a level much lower Hebrews

5 1 through 10 I shall read it in The

Jerusalem 2001 let's see what he says

let's see if the doctrine improved a bit

over here maybe it improved Hebrews 5 1

through 10 let's see Jerusalem 2001 I

like the way it's written there it says

for every high priest

we know that it's kind got old butter

well that's the way it's written for

every high priest is chosen from among

men and is appointed to act on behalf of

men in relation to a Lehane to offer

gifts and sacrifices for sins that's

perfect the high the Kahane gavel was

chosen from amongst men it was not an

angel just like the first of them all

was Aaron the first of them all Aaron

was men - he can deal gently with the

ignorant and wayward since he himself

has beset with weakness of course he's

men because of this he is obligated to

offer sacrifices for his own sins just

as he does for those of the people

obviously he's a man every man is a

sinner and he offers for his own sins

and for those of others he's that kind

of all

or and no one takes this honor for

himself but only when called by Elohim

just as Aaron was exactly no one can

self the nominate themselves to Cohan

God all a high priest for the newbies

no one can self the nominee but it was a

nomination by Elohim we're doing fine up

to there right okay then five even so

the Messiah also did not take upon

himself the honor of being Kahane gavel

that's where he messed up right there he

messed up right there because it says

the Messiah didn't self-proclaimed as

going devil but rather the father Elohim

appointed the Messiah even saw the

Messiah also did not take upon himself

the honor of becoming a high priest but

rather he received it of him who told

him you are my son today I have begotten

you and again we go back to Psalms 2

once again to this garbage

interpretation go back there he's like

even as it says elsewhere your kohanga

go forever after the order of

Melchisedec who in the days of his flesh

when he had offered up prayers and

supplications with strong crying and

tears and to him that was able to save

him from death and was heard in that he

feared and even being a son ok ok ok ok

everything that I said he's talking

about Yeshua I'll read again who Yeshua

who Yeshua whom we understand to be

Yahweh of whom precisely the son said

here is Yahweh who having offered up in

the days of his flesh of issue speaking

of Yahweh in the days of his flesh

prayers and supplications the author

says that Yahweh supplicated whom did he

supplicate to why did he supplicate

prayers and supplications with strong

crying and tears and to him

was able to save him from death wait a

minute this is an absolute blasphemy

according to this garbage author says

that Yahweh or Yeshua supplicated with

crying tears until him to save him from

death that is what this author is saying

you have it in your Bibles do you think

that's Yahweh is that the savior of the

world if he came with a mission why is

he gonna cry to be saved from death to

him who supposedly sent him that's if

they were to but since we know that

yahwah came for his bride

if yahwah came for his bride i was he

gonna cry out i don't want to die for my

bride and whom is he crying - he's

Yahweh is he gonna cry out - an angel

the only one he crowd - was the bride

saying I have to die for you

Wow am I sure of what I'm about to do

might it be true that you deserve for me

to die for you

that's the only thing cry out because

above Yahweh there's no one yes being in

a created being that is worthless but

there are braver human beings and that

because if a human goes to dine war he's

not supplicating don't kill me don't

kill me if you have a little bit of

bravery doesn't care to be killed

they'll tell you shoot if you're men

enough or else you're something else so

then you're saying a human being

because a human being that is really his

macho and his brave does not supplicate

to anybody he says if you have to kill

me kill me be brave though it is so then

here it describes to me with

supplications and prayers and a strong

crying and tears but we're talking gay

but the gayest I've ever seen in my life

unto him that was able to save him from

death hold on he sure came to supplicate

to be saved from death this author is an

imbecile do we agree with that or not he

says who was able to save him from death

he was hurt due to his reverent attitude

and even being a son wait even being a

son by the things which he suffered he

learned obedience

sylvain Yeshua came to learn abuse as

well and here's where all the Adventists

say since he learned obedience you also

have to learn obedience since he kept

the law you must also keep it just like

him if you don't keep it just like him

you're a great sinner that is what the

Adventist say you sure came to give us

an example how many times did you hear

that hold on that's a blasphemy you sure

came to give us an example that is a

blasphemy because the example he gave us

doesn't help because he didn't sin so

then with that example he if we were

already in the wrong if we're already

messed up then that's worse it's as if

you don't know how to hit a ball at all

and you try to hit the ball and you miss

the ball a tennis ball let's say from

tennis ball from tennis ball and there

comes I don't know Federer and he says

this is how you hit a ball and he leaves

two three swings you saw it is not gonna

help you a lot

no even worse because you're gonna try

to hit it with that speed and you're

even gonna let go of the racket and hit

somebody

you're gonna hit somebody are you gonna

break your racket so then wait if you

sure came to teaches we're left even

worse than before he came even worse

because he came to show us what

perfection isn't he left so then this

writer actually wrote an entire piece of

garbage and I'm sick of it if you liked

it that's perfect but this is not my

name this is not Yahweh he says an even

being a son due to the sufferings so

then he came to suffer to learn

obedience so then he was disobedient and

he came to learn what obedience and

being made perfect so he wasn't perfect

he had to be made perfect the issue had

to be made perfect when I make something

perfect it's because it wasn't perfect

before right

just like this entire eternal truth it's

been completely imperfect since I

started speaking and since I'm so

imperfect we had to perfect things it is

fulfilled in every human being but in

Yahweh so then it says and being made

perfect he became the author of eternal

salvation so then when he came he

couldn't save anybody he had to become

obedient he had to suffer

he had to turn gay to cry for salvation

and supplicate for his life and get to

perfection - barely then be able to save

us he says he became the author of

eternal salvation unto all them that

obey Him proclaim pilo him all by Allah

him the Father

Kohen Gadol after the order of

melchizedek southern this is nothing but

garbage and blasphemy what I've just

read but why did I read all this because

there's always those who write to me and

say but it says here the author of

Psalms 2 says the father and the son

that it is Yahweh and his son Jesus they

say the Bible says it okay last Shaban I

didn't think it was necessary to read

this I thought you were grown-ups and

that you weren't gonna quote it's

incredible I teach something and they

quote me already saying and what are we

gonna do with this here okay toss this

into the garbage can it's as simple as

that into the garbage can or not throw

me into the garbage can either of the

two because I say this is piece of

garbage

Paul's garbage and the interpretation of

Psalms 2 of all Christendom isn't our

garbage keep one of the two just like

that one of the two either one or the

other

the truss says there's only one there's

no father and there's only one when the

Sun came and he said I'm the father are

one he gives a key

he said he that has seen me has seen the

father how much Sun it shows the father

how long have I been with you you

haven't known me you sure has the cleave

we don't want to see it that's fine see

two people see three people see four

people I don't care many people you see

I could care less but the keys there if

you want to see it if you don't want to

see it that is your problem I saw it I

taught it do with that what you please

there is only one soul divine person

who's related to us that there's other

him yes but they have no relation to us

that they're his kin I don't have any

probable that but that for us as human

beings as everything that is here

related there is only one Elohim the

Shema says it one alone one alone there

was one one saw creator one saw Savior

once a person whom we should worship and

in the new earth there will be one alone

with one soul named there's no more

father and son the father and sons are

great great parable and blessed are they

who understand it understand it now when

another comes in elaborates say no

because the father blessed a son and he

inherited everything and he learned I

can already see that he doesn't have the

parable if he has not understood the

parable then what he's about to say is

worthless because what he's about to say

will confuse me do you understand it is

completely so because if I see that a

biblical with their chore falls has not

understood the parable what good is it

to me he's gonna continue to confuse me

he doesn't understanding he'll explain

what he doesn't understand once I

understand something I don't want his

explanation I don't want that now this

this is a deceit not an explanation

because here things are said there are

brutal as that about Yeshua coming to

learn obedience is that what you sure

came to do to learn obedience and then

to pray to supplicate from to be saved

from death what did he come to do that

was his only mission but please any

common evil man is braver than that you

should that they're showing me there do

you see that or do you think I'm wrong

because here either Hebrews goes to the

garbage are the eternal truth to the

garbage but I consider Hebrews a piece

of garbage already I told you that today

I was gonna handle it with care I'll

carefully place it in the garbage bin I

carefully place the book in the garbage

bin not that I may use it to quote

something maybe I will but it is now at

the level of garbage and let me tell you

for years

I fought so as to not remove Hebrews

okay I did even the impossible any of

you will take that book out its piece of

garbage yeah there are things that are

like there are certain things I thought

many times to keep that book thousands

tons but already with this haven't

understood this haven't understood the

Shema that was the drop that spilled the

glass or the grain needed to say false

book he understand this a special day

today I declared Hebrews false it took

me many years in 2012 I could have said

Hebrew

was made by Paul and he goes to the

garbage it took me six years because I

didn't want to throw Hebrews away I

didn't want to because there are things

that I liked in it how many things that

I liked that Paul said if I were to tell

you you'd start to like him again I like

many things that Paul said there's a

reason why he is the idol of Christendom

Paul isn't just anything but he purrs I

fought six years tough to throw it away

but today struck all day the day we got

to the moon give or take

how many years ago from the year that I

was born 69 the year that Lesley was

born 69 that day when we got to the moon

if we stepped on the moon then Hebrews

is true but he who likes it I'll leave

it for you I'll leave it for you and yet

it seems like Paul wrote it due to the

rubbish that I've just read it would

seem as if Paul did write it so then

today's I struggle day and some people

tell me if you keep taking up books

we're gonna be left of that books today

we have one less book but the Torah is

immovable the entire Tanakh isn't

movable let's start there not just at

Roth the Tanakh the entire tonight

except for the one we took out which one

was it

Esther a star we did away with the star

they start the story of the star in my

book we did away with it I think it's

the only one we did away with from there

right because it doesn't belong to

anything that one is out out out okay it

is 140 and it's been two hours of

preaching and barely now I would have to

present to you this subject of John 16

which is impressive but I will not

present it today I mean you don't even

want to watch the videos tell truth if

you we're watching them I see how many

people watch them I published them 200

views 300 views who could care about

these subjects

maybe you're content with what you've

seen but oh well today's subject is to

demonstrate why some stew has all of

Christendom with the wrong

interpretation why did we have it until

the day of yesterday the day of lash a

bet in the previous study why did we

take it out and why does Christendom

have that interpretation due to Paul

ended to the author of Hebrew

whoever he may be because of those two

they have already defined that Psalms 2

is referring to Elohim and it refers to

his son Jesus an explanation that's

completely outside the reality exactly

how many likes does that video have you

can go see it I mean Lex doesn't have

and how many views does it have the last

one I'm talking about the very last one

yes exactly look at the rest very few

people watch them so then if I make it

long even less people watch them a short

video they were like how long is it two

hours well I could watch it for two

hours I'm gonna make one hour once maybe

45 minute once and people will start

watching them but no I'm just playing I

can't speak for just an hour

but anyway actually if if I give you now

John 16 it'll take us another two hours

it'll take us another two hours and

actually it is an impressive subject

there's a lot to learn there it is

rather impressive John 16 yrs and I want

to present it precisely in the best

possible way so then we shall meet again

next chapter of the bride of Yeshua

Alleluia to every one of you let us

conclude with a word of Prayer beloved

you assured that art in heaven blessed

be thy name Lord we give you thanks

because you show us with your word what

is true and what is not true you are

yahwah eloheem who came to earth to die

for his bride to give life to his bride

blessed art thou

yahwah is about Yeshua HaMashiach Lord

we are expecting you because we live in

a world that has no solution which every

day is more corrupt which every day the

darkness and darkening even more Laurey

it is already time that all the

prophecies that you have left written in

the true books be fulfilled we're

already in the 70th week and it is time

that all your fury and wrath be poured

over Babylon come and look for his Lord

because we live on an earth

that's abandoned unrighteous and we're

actually suffering and we're ready that

you come and look for us we understand

that there is only one person who is our

Creator who is our Savior and who is our

Elohim yah was about all the glory and

all the honor be for you all this we ask

in the name through which you presented

yourself on earth Yeshua HaMashiach
