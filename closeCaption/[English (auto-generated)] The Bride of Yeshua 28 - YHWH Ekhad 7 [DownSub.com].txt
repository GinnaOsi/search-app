shabbat shalom

chosen lineage of Israel and friends

accompanying us on this so precious and

ultra heated day of Shabbat from

California the US of A we shall study

yet another chapter of the bride of

Yeshua number 28

Yahweh had seven today's topic is rather

magnificent it's a topic of which we

could make an entire series of the two

chapters were about to study actually

these two chapters there is no way of

enclosing them in one sole study because

these chapters are rather so rich so

magnificent something which the

Christians comprehend not and of course

the Jewish religion also does not

compound but today we shall try to at

least read them and to try to understand

them a little more we're already living

Shevat 71 we've already left what number

70 the 70th has been fulfilled and today

is Shabbat number five of a Shevat 71

today is Shabbat 14 of the fourth month

which the Jews called the month of the

God tameness from Babylon we're on the

year five thousand nine hundred eighty

seven we are twelve years away from

completing the six thousand years at its

maximum point allotted to this earth

corresponding to the 20th of July of the

year 2018 in the Roman Catholic

Gregorian calendar and this week we have

lived some astonishing signs in the sky

of which we shall speak about a little

bit now let us seek our Elohim by

reverently bowing our heads blessed art

thou Yahweh's have out we give you

thanks Lord because you have chosen us

to be your people you have formed Israel

you have designed Israel you have

instructed Israel and we are your

children I ask you Lord that your

blessing with which you promised and you

gave that blessing to our father Abraham

may it reach us today and that all those

promises are fulfilled we desire to live

with you forever for you are our only

Elohim Yahweh set out all this Lord we

asked for in the precious name by which

you came to this earth Yeshua HaMashiach

our elohim has blessed with another year

of life the following members of the

eternal truth

Vienna Marcelo Sanchez Columbia or Neel

Martinez Hernandez of the Dominican

Republic

Alexander Fabian Hernandez Mexico Bryan

Steven Hernandez Andrade Columbia House

a yepez Venezuela Lela Hernandez Peru

ISA Villa Rodriguez Hernandez Colombia

but Tricia Mena Venezuela but 3 semanas

birthday was two weeks ago on the 14th

of July and lesha bet we saw and enjoyed

her true matrimony so then we now have

the correct birth date and pesos David

Ortiz Colombia - every one of you

lineage of the eternal truth may our

Elohim Yahweh continue to bless you I

have received a question or maybe as a

comment that we do wrong in celebrating

the birthdays because we know that the

only registered birth date in the Bible

is that of Herod of King Herod and that

whole story that King Herod was a pagan

King and that for his birthday wanted to

have sex because of that dance he wanted

to have sex with the daughter of his

wife who really wasn't his wife but

rather the wife of his brother his

sister-in-law and so then he wanted to

have sex with her daughter in that dance

it is implied it wasn't just a little

harmless dance it was something else and

so that's why certain groups of

Christians say we do not celebrate

birthdays because isn't it but paganism

and blah blah blah okay

actually the word

days taking out of course that

neuro-linguistic programming connotation

which is imposed on that word we do not

celebrate birthdays as they are

celebrated in Babylon in the world

we thank Yahweh our Creator for having

given us and having sustained our life

he is the giver of life he gives life

and takes away life when we say that we

are thankful to Yahweh for the birthday

we're precisely thinking on a date that

is rather symbolic for it is in the

Gregorian calendar that we have our our

birthday implied but it is not a feast

to please the human being nor celebrate

the human being but rather to celebrate

our Elohim who created us in who

sustains our life it is rather a miracle

that we're alive people die by the bunch

for diverse causes that you already know

any anomaly whatever accident whoever

who crosses their path with an evil

person life ends there so then really it

is a joy to be alive and conscious in

this world in this time that's so

special that's what we celebrate but we

don't celebrate it towards the person

but rather we celebrate it in gratitude

towards Allah Haim the focus is to thank

Elohim there's always been a count of

how old the people were if you read out

of better sheet it would say so many

years this person live and died at so

many years he begat so and so Noah was

600 years old when the flood came he was

601 when he came out of the ark so then

in order to have an accountability of

time that we're conscious and alive in

this life there is an account and that

account is not a sin it is not what the

Christians

Herod was not a pagan King Herod was the

king of Israel now that he sinned that

does not mean that he sinned because he

celebrated his birthday but rather he

sinned in the way he celebrated his

birthday so then when we say things that

make no sense

you're all pagans because you celebrate

birthdays you're going to hell birthdays

are not celebrated they're not mentioned

nothing in fact it's the most boring day

of your life it should be because if you

have fun in something then you're a

pagan they're wrong people are easily

mistaken we do not worship the human

being we don't worship the birthday

person we worship Elohim who gives us

the capacity and the privilege of being

able to live if tonight we die there is

no more celebrated birthdays here that

is why we actually rejoice with the life

of our lineage when someone of our

lineage has a birthday we rejoice

because they are still with us for their

living this incredible time in which

every one of the prophets of Allah heme

would have liked to live any one of them

whoever he may be

he would have liked to live the final

times just like in the movies the games

the best part is always at the end the

best parts always at the incident for us

to live at the end and to get to be

alive is a great great motive to

celebrate now that related to paganism

it's got nothing to do obviously if you

were to celebrate a child and you make

him a cake and you buy him balloons and

you make a whole party directed to the

child you're harming instead of

benefiting him why does it harm him

because all the family gets together the

child becomes the eloheem because he had

a birthday are you following me here

that is the problem of inculcating unto

the children that they are the center

of attraction and attention at that

moment know the center of attraction and

of celebration is eloheem because Elohim

gives us life once we comprehend that

when we get to the time in which we are

accountably counting another year of

life we thank Elohim we make a feast for

Elohim obviously we make the simplest of

feasts and when we have a party and if

we invite people that are not part of

our lineage that believe in something

else

we're obviously giving a testimony

contrary to or turn to say if you say in

your mind I'm telling you this because

it may happen to you let's see have a

son and all of your family who is

Catholic Adventist or whatever comes and

you say I'm gonna celebrate my son and I

will thank Elohim but I'll invite all

the rest who did not worship eloheem and

worship someone else you're actually

lying to yourself because you're not

making a party in Granite's to eloheem

by inviting pagans because if it's a

face for eloheem and it's ingratitude to

eloheem the last thing along he wants is

for you to invite a whole bunch of

pagans to make the birthdays for your

son or daughter D follow so then be very

careful with my words we do not

celebrate birthdays towards man we thank

Elohim we mention it as it is mentioned

in the Bible and we thank Elohim is our

position left clear about birthdays very

well well no now there's a lot of Missy

antique are against it thing is that

they take out theories out of everywhere

everybody wants to have the truth

everyone's to say that what the other

des is wrong so then you start getting

the theories of all kinds all kinds

conspiracy theories about what sin is of

all types and if you act wrong and you

don't mention the children that they're

having

birthdays and you don't make a feast

that the child understand that we're

thanking somebody for his birthdays

you're also wrong you'd like today's

your birthday but we're not gonna do

anything

nothing nothing we're not gonna thank

I'll hang nothing so then actually you

become not pagan but atheist because you

don't thank Elohim who gives life be

your own judge this is the position of

us as a group proverbs 25:2 the glory of

Elohim is to conceal the word yet it is

the honor of the King to search the word

the word is concealed difficult to

understand it's not in plain sight we

have to search the word to find the

truth it is all written in parables

yesterday which was a Friday for us but

it was already a Shabbat for Europe and

for part of Asia and also specifically

for Israel a phenomenon took place in

heaven which is incredible which is the

biggest Blood Moon of the century there

won't be a longer Blood Moon in terms of

duration than the one that took place

yesterday sine Yahweh said that he

placed the Sun the moon and the stars as

signs so then when something happens in

the Sun the Moon the stars they are

signs not because we made that up but

because it's in better she and it is

absolutely clear the sign we saw in the

sky a Blood Moon red impressive I shared

a link there are many links where you

could see live directly what was

happening as a view had been right there

at that place and actually the moon

started to get covered up it became red

it lasted blood-red for an hour and a

half there was something that didn't

video but next to the moon there was

another witness as the scriptures say

that in order for something to be true

you need two witnesses whether it has

anything to do with this I don't know

but the other red star the color of

blood is called Mars it's a planet

it's a wandering star that red planet

accompanied the Moon and Mars was

closest to the earth than ever I don't

remember ever having seen more so big as

a child I never saw Mars

I'm sure what's going around there but

it was just another dot in the sky but

now you can clearly see something

different it seems to be a red star in

the sky but yesterday there were two

witnesses the color of blood not just

the moon Mars next to the moon bigger

than ever in an eclipse there are things

that one says all of it together yes all

of it together right on the Eclipse and

Mars was closest to the earth than ever

both of them read over Israel then

Elohim is showing us a sign

precisely when Israel has just completed

their 70th year this didn't happen

before this is fulfilled on the year in

which Israel completes its 70th year a

Blood Moon dual witnesses with the red

blood star over Israel an hour and a

half on the day which is st. Valentine's

for them just to Bev the day of love a

tremendous manifestation that went past

the work of men

that's just his role as completing their

70th year but Korea is also on their

70th year and I precisely think that it

was very related to yesterday 27th of

July Korea was fulfilling their 70th

year or since the ceasefire between the

two Koreas 70 years to the look look how

special a time on the same day in which

there was a ceasefire between Korea

seventy years afterward we see these

these two signs because it's not one

sign it's two signs did you get that

we've only ever seen the sign of just

the moon but neither word two blood

luminaries in the sky that's impressive

dual sign on a date of festivities for

Israel on Israel 70th birthday on a

Shabbat also Korea is related to that

and there's also a lot more

organizations such as UNESCO as well as

other organizations as the worldwide

Council of Churches they're all on their

70th birthday the hour of judgment has

arrived for every 170 years I was

listening to an Orthodox Jewish rabbi

who was explaining that Israel has lost

the sacredness the sacredness of the

signs of the sky every time that he

would explain every time there was a

Blood Moon in the sky over Israel every

Israelite knew a long time ago that

there was a judgement drawing nigh from

Elohim over Israel Blood Moon judgment

of Allah he movor Israel if Israel was

complying well with the word then they

would receive a blessing because the

judgment doesn't mean a curse a

judgments a judgment you can be greatly

benefitted or you can fare really bad

southern according to how Israel was

complying with the commandments the

myths votes then yahwah could either

give a great blessing over israel or a

terrible curse the solar eclipses have

nothing to do with Israel but with the

pagan nations undergoing the Gentiles so

then when solar eclipse would be

produced they knew that a judgment was

coming over the pagan nations if the

pagan nations were

working wickedness in the eyes of Yahweh

they were punished if they were doing

good things than they were blessed it

would depend a judgment is drawing nigh

how are you are you gonna lose that

judgment or are you gonna be victorious

in that judgment well yesterday was the

announcement of a judgement there comes

a judgement over Israel how do you think

Israel welfare out of that judgment a

blood moon on a Shabbat two witnesses

dual witnesses of blood then from

yesterday on their initiates according

to the sign in the sky a judgment of

Israel we shall see how Israel comes out

of that judgment Chris the longest or

the biggest the longest and the biggest

the longest and biggest judgment as well

let's see how they fare according to

prophecy they'll have an awful outcome

maybe a few will be saved

from there very few but as a nation

they'll fare badly as a leader they

won't pass as holy pigs as in Spanish

priests mean they won't - well and with

all the plants that they have of

rebuilding the temple the outcome will

be even worse because there is an

organization called the Oh what was it

called something about the temple do you

remember the name oh well I forgot for

now the not to study something but the

temple can't remember it's an official

organization they made all the utensils

for the temple they made all the

clothing for the priests where they've

got all the priests they've got it all

absolutely everything to initiate the

rebuilding of the temple they've got it

all a lot Burke oh they announced that

the Ark of the Covenant has already been

found some say now they didn't find it

what happens is that they made a new one

it is absolutely new it

is called the Institute of the temple

thank you the Institute of the temple of

Israel it is an official organization

placed by Israel to rebuild the temple

the Christians of course with their

Pauline doctrine they are waiting for

the temple to be rebuilt so that the

Antichrist shows up halfway through the

seven years and Fred this stopped the

sacrifices so then the Christians say we

know that we're not already at the end

because the temple has to be built first

once they rebuilt the temple that's when

the last seven years begin once they

start with the sacrifices and everything

the Antichrist will show up halfway

through those seven last years three and

a half years into it and he will stop

the sacrifices and say I sit here as

Paul says I sit here so then the men of

sin as they say will sit as God in the

temple of God and will make himself be

called God second Thessalonians two you

know about Emory what Paul says so then

they're like before the temple shows up

the man of sin cannot appear and sit

down in the temple so we're not at the

end first let them build the temple we

can kick back most of them are kicked

back where they kick back because

there's no temple but the prophecy does

not say that the rebuilding of the

temple will be real if it is or not that

rebuilding that's the least of my

concerns but I and you perfectly know

that the temple is not necessary for the

unchaining of the great brutal

tribulation so then the ideas of

building the temple are there they've

got it all even the Ark all of it all of

it all of it all of it

what they need is either a war to

destroy that mosque there or a false

flag attempt to say who destroyed it or

something which we don't know but what

we do know is that what happened in

Israel ten days ago which I had not

mentioned

to you but 10 days ago what happened is

that a law was passed by Israel as never

before I can imagine you have heard of

this law Israel approves the Knesset

have you heard of this it is the basic

law Israel nation-state of the Jewish

people

this was 2 Thursday's ago local town of

Israel the law Israel as the national

state of the Jewish people was approved

with 62 votes in favor and 55 against

it's a lot that they've been trying to

approve long ago you haven't heard of

this law certain points of the law

called my attention as if to say a new

constitution so you understand this law

look for example basic principles I'll

mention them because they really caught

my attention I'll sum it up basic

principles a the Land of Israel is the

historical nation of the Jewish people

in which the State of Israel was founded

B the State of Israel is the national

home of the Jewish people in which

Israel exercises their natural cultural

religious and historical right to

self-determination in other words

they've got an absolute independence

from the rest of the world see the right

to exercise national self-determination

in the State of Israel is exclusively of

the Jewish people in other words this

law passed because Trump made Jerusalem

the capital when that power was given

them precisely on the 70th year when

that power was given to the Jewish

people the Jewish people said okay now

that we're backed up by the strongest

nation in the world now we will say that

Israel is absolutely an independent

state with many things included in the

law that before had not passed

for example to the symbols of the state

a the name of the state is Israel the

flag is white with two blue lines close

to the borders and the Star of David

which is blue in the center that starv

David was invented by them the emblem of

the state is a menorah of seven arms

with olive leaves on both sides in the

word Israel below that is the emblem of

the State of Israel a menorah why

because Israel's the light of the world

what's the menorah the light the state

him is Hatikvah which was written by the

creator of the state of israel the

details as in respects to the state

symbols shall be determined by the law

the capital of the state Jerusalem

entirely and United is the capital of

Israel it is already in their

constitution now language the language

of the state is Hebrew the Arabic

language has a special status in this

state but what is the official language

Hebrew the regulation of the use of

Arabic in state institutions or for them

is established by the law so then

actually whatever's got to do with the

government has to be in Hebrew this

really made the Arabs very upset because

now the Palestinians are really way into

a corner see this article does not harm

the state given to the Arabic language

before this law comes into force aha

doesn't harm it absolutely takes away

its value gathering of those in exile it

says the state will be open for the

Jewish emigration and the gathering of

those in exile connects

with the people the state shall be

enforced to guaranteed the security of

the members of the Jewish people in

problem or in captivity due to their

Jewish condition or their citizenship

the state shall act within the Diaspora

which is those in exile to reinforce the

affinity between the state and the

members of the Jewish people the state

must act to preserve the natural

historical and religious patrimony of

the Jewish people among the Jews of that

diaspora

the state sees the development of the

Jewish settlement as a national treasure

and shall act to encourage and promote

its establishment and consolidation now

this really called my attention official

calendar the Hebrew calendar is the

official calendar of the state and next

to the Gregorian calendar it shall be

used as an official calendar the use of

the Hebrew calendar in the Gregorian

calendar shall be determined by the law

so then there are a lot more points in

this law Independence Day in memorable

days Independence Day is the official

state holiday the day in memory of those

fallen in the Wars of Israel and the

daned remembrance of the Holocaust don't

you dare forget in heroism our official

state commemorate

thanks to the supposed Holocaust that

the State of Israel forum point number

10

powerfully called my attention days of

rest and Shabbat this is official mind

you the Shabbat and the feasts of Israel

are the established days of rest in the

state so then legally the Shabbat in the

established days indicated by their

calendar not ours

not ours it says that

established by the state non Jewish

people have the right to rest on their

Sabbath's

and festive days so if you're not Jewish

but you closed your business the law

backs you up details on this matter

shall be determined by the law in other

words notice this officially the state

of israel says that shabbat is a day of

rest not just the Sabet but the rest of

the show bets are the more a team

I found out to be Wow I found it

Wow it says this basic law will not be

able to be modified except through the

approval of another basic law approved

but the majority of the members of the

Knesset that is the Congress what does

this mean that they can't just regulate

a little point from their notes wrigley

at one point they'd have to regulate the

entire law which gets complicated do you

see so then this is basic law it is the

Constitution of the State of Israel it

is impressive I tell the truth I mean

I'll tell you what it really caught my

attention for the State of Israel to

officially make the Shabbat be the

official day of rest and the modem

according to their calendar obviously I

agree with that not everybody has to

have the same calendar the calendar they

believe to be true but Israel here

officially says from now on the

Chipettes our official days of the state

in which you must rest

I still remember sermons in 2008 when

back in 2000 70s to watch Gambetta and

other pastors needs to say in Israel

there's already a Dominica law that lies

nothing but lies now it is clear that

what day is kept in Israel the Shabbat

and in a way that it is in their own

Constitution I found it to be very very

impressive this article of course it's

not obligatory to keep it but it does

give you the guarantee that you have the

right to keep it which is

rather awesome it's awesome so then

let's say you work at a company and they

say you have to work on tschappat I have

to come in shebat but the law guarantees

me that I have the right to take the

Chevette off and it's over now if I want

to work as an Israelite that's my

problem but if I don't want to work I

legally can say I legally don't work and

they can't tell you a thing they cannot

take another employee over you because

you don't want to work on Shabbat and

not just don't so bad but all the feasts

and what we're talking about feasts they

take look they don't observe them the

way we do I've been way too permissive

and what it says there because I taught

you it would be good that during PASOK

you don't work that you take all the

ages of Pesach that would be right but

then they learn all the rest don't work

it'll be great if in saqqaq you didn't

have to work

oh I have to leave early today cuz I

have to check on a little job

it'd be great if you didn't work the

Israelites take those days entirely

absolutely completely and now that is

backed up by the constitutional law so

then let's say you have let's say you're

an employee and they're like gotta come

to work what am I now I gotta come to

work and the whole nation is on the same

page on the same calendar that is what's

interesting if we were to live there and

we would be like wait in our calendar

it's a month back there there you would

get into all kinds of trouble that's why

it's got its pros and it's cons here

we're seeing a unification of the rules

amongst orthodox among Zionists amongst

everybody every time they try to pass

the law once you understand

they always voted against it but now it

passed and now that it's passed it's

been set firm and when did it pass on

the 70th year

exactly

another comes a judgement let's Eve does

laws enough lets Eve this law is enough

for something this law here

our friend of the eternal truth who is

in the land of the angels fallen angels

England

Felix wrote to me and told me this that

I had not seen in the news he said hi

Christian and lineage I'd like to inform

you that during this week a heat wave

has unleashed itself that has lowered

the level of the waters both rivers and

lakes and the people that live on boats

and ships the government has had to

evacuate them because the level of the

 turkan else do not support the

boats and ships water level goes down

they touch the floor and they can be

turned over but I had not read that in

the news

I had read all types of disasters due to

the heat wave but not in England he goes

on and the people who are found washing

their means of transportation their cars

or whatever you have if they catch them

washing them or watering their gardens

they must pay a fee of a thousand pretty

spends if they catch you watering your

garden a bit I found this incredible

because we're talking about England

England is a giant island surrounded by

water but the water is disappearing how

do you understand that we understand

that this world is changing we're living

in strange times with strange things

happening the disasters we see in

Vietnam Japan and in other parts of the

world's is terrible absolutely terrible

I think I already know the news the

forest fires in California forest fires

in Greece they were impressive the

people would run out of their cars

whilst they would desperately run

towards the sea their clothing would be

set on fire the cars were left all empty

like that because there were places

where they would come in driving fast

they'd break open the doors indirectly

to the sea because of the brutal heat

that was produced by those forest fires

never before seen I already lost count

of how many dead people are its

impressive impressive the world has

never lived that if he had been standing

there in that pace or in any of those

places you'd be saying the Great

Tribulation has begun it's begun because

what's worst than for you to see people

all over the place and burning to death

and that you yourself burning what worse

I mean for people to tell you the seven

plagues of the Apocalypse what do you

care if a plague just took a hold of

either Roland with your life or that

almost end your life or your families

that destroyed your house everything you

owned that has changed forever so then

for all those thousands of people's

around the world the apocalypse has

begun and it's almost over because also

died it already started in and it's over

but that decades that the world's gone

to a saint course a destructive course

it is really changing whether we are or

not integrate tribulation oil as it

turns out last Shabbat there was a

question that I will say I will answer

they asked me a question very important

I saw the question to be very important

but last Tibet we weren't able to answer

it something also took place last

Shabbat for all those who watch the

video now for all who are ok with just

what they here live and know much the

videos didn't even notice but for those

who actually review and really want to

learn what was spoken of in the steady

notice that all of a sudden 10-15

minutes into the video of good image and

then it changed the image became

horrible horrible sound horrible

everything what happens is that there

was a failure in the camera I think it

was the card and it got ruined so I hope

I mean that card we already discarded it

hope it won't happen again

and if it's the camera it may happen

again I hope that I hope there isn't any

more problems of that type but right the

Great Tribulation got to the camera for

that same reason

am i commenting that it wasn't a bad

edition or anything I thank Allah him

that this time the Facebook video didn't

cut off it is complete and the Bessette

was not lost I found it to be very

impressed

the question that they asked me was this

give or take couple words if I feel the

need of asking for forgiveness or just

because I feel like it if I have to

desire or the necessity of kneeling to

pray they're like is this wrong because

you have taught in previous chapters

that we should no longer kneel down to

pray farewell I that's the question

basically I will answer now I promised

that I would give a study on prayer then

I saw that the study was not necessary

because there were other topics that

were more important but maybe I

expressed myself in a way well which is

typical in me when I'm explaining a

topic it's typical of me I expressed

myself in a way that is way too dark

Maddock or maybe in a way that it was

misunderstood what I said about how I no

longer kneel down to prayer and I

recommended that you do not pray

kneeling down because were no longer

servants but were invited to be the

bride of Yahweh the bride of Yahweh does

not kneel down before her husband

because that actually sets us at a level

of servant and not of a bride and then I

compared it to the Arabs and all those

that throw themselves to the floor

kneeling down and all the rest okay

today I shall clarify the point a little

bit very lightly I'm not gonna make a

study about prayer or anything we're in

a different study which I consider to be

more important actually what I want to

say is as follows if you have the desire

intimately for whatever reason and maybe

of kneeling down do it because I don't

see it as wrong if we kneel before

Yahweh for whatever reason if your heart

is Laden if your heart feels the

necessity of asking for forgiveness or

to seek Yahweh and you see that you

really at least mentally or if your mind

does not allow you to do it any other

way and you feel that you not be

respectful towards Yahweh a view pray in

a different position then go ahead kneel

do not fret absolutely at all over it

over what I said of not kneeling that is

up to everybody's own personal

understanding per se if you must kneel

there is no problem in kneeling but

actually when we comprehend that we are

the bride it's as if a new desire were

to grow towards Elohim we want to be the

companion of Elohim for all eternity and

we don't want to have to be always with

our face on the ground before Elohim

follow eternity we won't be as bride so

then but that's a balance that you must

analyze if you really feel the need of

kneeling there is no problem with to

ever go ahead kneel I don't see it as a

problem if I were to feel it I would

actually have no problem in kneeling

before him

there's me there are two types of

worship I suggested what I suggested is

which was more than anything a

suggestion to understand that we are the

bride once we understand we're the bride

our mind starts to change somewhere or

another but actually since there are so

many examples so many examples you

should knelt down the prophets also did

a whole lot of people did but we're

talking a different time we're not

talking about man of the sixth day when

he was gonna be given a different light

so then we cannot compare what the

prophets did in a different epochs

because then we'd have to also take into

consideration the sacrifices they did so

then there are things in which we're

advancing but I don't see it as wrong a

repeat again if you wish to kneel down

Shaima Israel Yahweh Elohim Yahweh HUD

that is the basic truth of the eternal

truth that basic rule even though it was

not exposed in the light in which were

seeing it now it was a basic truth

ever since the Ministry of the eternal

truth came out because the eternal truth

has always were

diaw way it's been spoken that Yeshua is

Yahweh since the very beginning that our

Creator is Yeshua that our redeemer

yeshua that our counselors yeshua that

our saviors yeshua that the holy spirit

is Yeshua that everything is you sure

that also we understood that there was a

father but that father was not related

to the human being everything is about

Yeshua that was spoken of since the very

beginning of this ministry we now

comprehend Yahweh had at a level in

which I wants us to comprehend it that

he is one alone he is absolutely one

alone Isaiah 46 8 through 13 Spanish

Matheny Otto says remember this and

understand it well enter into reason ye

sinners remember of the days of old that

I am Elohim and there is no I am NOT we

are I am

it is absolutely singular and no other

Elohim exists and no one is like unto me

this is the beginning I announce the end

and beforehand that which has not yet

happened I say my decision not our

decision my decision for I am one alone

is fulfilled and everything which I

please I execute it from the orient I

call the evil from a far country the man

which I have designated as I say it I do

it as I plan it I executed hearken unto

me ye stout hearted people ye that are

far away from truth my justice is nigh

and my salvation is not a far away it

shall not tarry

I shall give my salvation to Zion and my

glory unto Israel where's the glory of

y'all going to and to Israel if the

Yahweh of glory is this one I'm a

Christian I think I'm Gentile

when will I receive the glory of Yahweh

when I will never receive the glory of

Yahweh as long as I understand that I am

a or a Gentile no matter how much I

accept Christ as long as I continue to

be a Gentile

I will never receive the glory of Yahweh

Jeremiah

16 19 through 21 knock our Colunga

Yahweh my strength and my fortress my

refuge in the day of tribulation who is

our refuge and the day of tribulation

yahweh until they shall come the peoples

from the ends of the earth and shall say

nothing but lies was the inheritance of

her father's vanity in which there's no

veil if it is men making himself the

gods then they are not gods

that's why behold I shall make you known

this time I shall show you the strength

the power of my arm and you shall know

that my name is Yahweh now we shall

study and no matter how long it takes I

hope that it goes in within the two

hours proposed but it could get a little

longer but we've got to study this today

because next week we've got a study

that's rather very very special which

will change your perception on an

impressive chapter of Scripture which we

had misunderstood it what I say

next week we saw understand it correctly

let us go to Isaiah 43 in other words

the entire chapter I shall read it in

the Spanish Diablo II and I shall turn

with other versions this chapter is

rather astonishing once we understand it

it is astonishing it is rather special

when we comprehend it well we see the

error of all other religious groups here

and we see the little that sometimes we

know Yahweh that little that sometimes

or the wrong that we were taught about

Yahweh this week I was I spent some time

listening to many many pastors and

Christian leaders about this chapter

because it's a chapter that I wanted to

see how they explained this because it

leaves out all the Gentiles it leaves

out anyone who's not of Israel it leaves

out the Trinity it leaves out the binary

system of two people it leaves everyone

else out this chapter this chapter is

rather astonishing that's what we shall

study it entirely and as I told you at

the beginning there is no way of

studying it in one study we're at least

gonna read it and we'll be comprehending

it a little bit more with this marvelous

chapter teaches text number one but now

Israel people of Jacob Yahweh who

created you tells you first of all

I'll stop right there who to whom is

this message directed to Ontario

just in case it says that with another

witness people have take up just in case

I'm just Israel no Israel people have

taken and then he says Yahweh who

created you Israel is not a people that

has been bunched up out of nowhere

Israel is not even a people that has

been elect in the sense of amongst all

the people I will choose that people

that's formed no no no no it is elected

to be created

yahwah chose Israel to create Israel in

other words Yahweh since the very

beginning

he designed Israel I want you understand

that y'all we didn't look at the nations

of the earth and was like let's see what

should I choose in all this here they're

all sinners they're all a disaster they

all worship the dragon let's see which

one I like not this one at that one that

that one I'll choose this one that is

what you call choosing yahwah did not

choose israel amongst troops yahwah

designed and created israel formed him

made him that is absolutely important to

start to comprehend fear not for I have

ransomed you i when he says I in Hebrew

it is absolutely clear that it is one

soul person speaking singularly not we

but I have called you by name your mind

so then even who gave the name to Israel

Yahweh called him by name he gave him

that name and he also told them you are

mine

in other words today we will record in

our mind something which is fundamental

aside from having the Shema that says

scheme' israel

here o Israel here or Israel whom is the

shame attracted to if I am a Gentile I

cannot listen because it doesn't say

here o Gentile it doesn't say here o

Christian it doesn't say here I

Adventists it says here home Israel

Yahweh Elohim Yahweh your Elohim Israel

not Christendom Yahweh your Elohim

Israel Yahweh is one alone for that

reason Israel has how many Elohim one

they understood that message world now

the Christians before understanding

anything else they should return they

should return and try to understand the

scriptures

that it's only one Elohim it's a two or

three it's one alone absolutely one

alone I am and no one else with me now

why does Israel exist why does this

rayul exist because of Israel would not

exist no one would know

Yahweh nor who created him you know what

this earth is know where we're headed

Israel's not just another people they

are the people they are not another

people they are the only people just

like there's only one Elohim there's one

people if you are a Gentile you're not a

part of the only people who has the only

eloheem because Israel was created by

Elohim to make it known to the entire

earth who Elohim is that's what Israel's

for never think for a second that Elohim

had the entire world unorganized and he

said I'm gonna choose these people to

make them my people no no Israel Yahweh

created Israel to make his name be known

to the entire world there isn't another

people that can say my Elohim is Yahweh

the only ones that say my Lehane is

Yahweh is Israel and if we are not

Israel the glory will never come to us

but we can only follow and look at

Israel how Israel will receive the glory

because the rest of us all we're gonna

do is receive judgment if we're not

Israel judgment if it's a judgment of

eternal life because we acted well well

have you turn a life but even so we'll

never be Israel ever Israel is the

created and chosen people to be the wife

so then the Gentiles understand

everything wrong they think they're the

wife of Christ I'm gonna say like that

the way they say we're the wife of

Christ as Christ gonna marry a people

home he didn't design whom he didn't

create him and didn't make how does a

false prophet like Paul Tarsus come to

say since Israel rejected the message

then the message that was designed for

Israel I charged Milo heme I'm gonna

take it to the Gentiles and he took

something holy or rather Kadosh and he

gave it to the Gentiles and the Gentiles

joyfully received it saying this isn't

for us but what do we have to do first

thing Paul did was the law the law is no

longer good he made it so easy because

if I'm a Gentile and I start to fulfill

the law what I become is an an Israelite

because Israel receives others in their

nation and you become a citizen of

Israel if you comply with the law what

did Paul do in his slyness that's where

there are so many millions of Christians

Paul took out the law because all C

would have turned everybody into

Israelites is like you are Gentiles and

you'll always be Gentiles and never be

anything else other than Gentiles and I

am your preacher and as Gentiles forget

about the trot it is no longer good that

was for a chosen people who were

rejected

because they rejected Yeshua they nailed

him and they nailed themselves now we

receive the salvation of that people but

easily no law no nothing is like just be

a good person you've got to carry out

certain things that it will tell you

says Paul about four Commandments I'll

give you and all the rest you're already

the bride he's like Yeshua divorced

himself of Israel but now marries the

Gentiles he doesn't demand anything of

the Gentiles just that they believe him

believe you and be saved not just you

but your entire household of sinners

yeah you're fornicating children there

will be saved as well because of your

faith so the new Christians say Wow a

message that's up to par easier for

human beings what humans want is for

anything to be easy if they have to buy

a car that's like $100,000 and they're

like no how can I pay for it I can't pay

for that and then

a guy comes along and says now those

under tells a lot as I paid very someone

else I'll let you pay $1 a month you

want it of course I want it who wouldn't

want that

well that is the devalued Christian

gospel they buy a salvation which is

impossible for them and they buy it at a

dirt cheap price which is just to

believe that is what Christianity is

southern yahwah begins by saying israel

people of jacob I am your Elohim Yahweh

he created you fear not for I have

liberated you Israel has already been

liberated why are they liberated because

Yahweh liberated them I Yahweh have

called you by your name you are mind

when you go through deep waters he's

speaking to Israel all Christians take

this text I'm telling because I am sick

of watching I lost count of all of all

the servants that I've seen about Isaiah

43 it was one after the other I wanted

to know what what these pastors were

saying to fix how they are not Israel

but they take this prophecy as if they

were Israel they're like here here jesus

promises says what does he promise us if

you've got to go through the waters I

will be with you well what a promise

that's so marvelous so then there are

many things promised us here that we're

gonna go through water Yahweh as the

elohim of israel does not tell you i'm

not gonna let you go through the waters

you'll always be dry without any

problems now he says you won't go

through the problems for every problem

that exists you will go through but the

difference is that I am with you and I

it's personal

Yahweh not a godsend not the son of

Yahweh not an angel Yahweh if you have

to cross the rivers you will not drown

if you've got to walk through the fire

you will not be burnt up the flames will

not consume you the only thing I see

here clearly the promise to Israel since

Elohim as only one eloheem who is Yahweh

if Israel

is faithful to Yahweh Yahweh will be in

every problem that Israel goes through

yahwah does not free you from problems

but rather he accompanies you and the

problems that's the difference of what

the chapter says if you think since I am

an Israelite and Yahweh's on my behalf I

don't have any problems that's not what

y'all was saying you won't go through

the waters you walk her through the fire

but he will be with you exactly he will

be with you three for I am Yahweh your

Savior

who is the Savior if you ask the

Christians who the Savior is Christ

Jesus Christ our Christ Jesus are peeled

in a different way just Jesus whatever

the Christ Christ the Savior but hold on

a moment here here it says I am Yahweh

your Savior I there's always the word I

am right there I am how is it that the

Trinitarians

didn't stop to think there is something

wrong here it doesn't say I am Christ

your savior it doesn't say I am christ

the son of Yahweh your Savior it doesn't

say that it's us all the contrary I am

Yahweh your Savior one soul eloheem one

soul Savior and his name is Yahweh the

Savior and who is it it tells you the

Elohim Kadosh of Israel Sultan there's

one soul eloheem that's why it's Yahweh

HUD once all eloheem once all creator

one soul Savior something there can't be

such things as Christ the Savior yah

with the father and Elohim called the

Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost such a thing

cannot exist because says I am and not

we are I'm highlighting this because if

you listen to the

or Christians how they explain

stupidities and the people come out of

there and raptured failed but the

promises of the Trinity over them when

he says I am I am I am

and it never says Yeshua he says Yahweh

I am Yahweh your Savior look what it

says here I once again I and I'm

highlighting those words so you

understand the singularity of Elohim I

have acquired you oh why are we saved as

Israelites why because Yahweh Baris I

have given as ransom Egypt Ethiopia and

Saba asked the Christians when did their

God give Egypt for them are you

following this Egypt was destroyed that

price I'm giving is I killed them for

you that is the price don't think that

he paid money to Egypt that's not what

this text is saying I have acquired you

I have given as ransom Egypt pieces for

you I give Egypt to destruction to death

I killed millions of Egyptians for you

Millions I killed Ethiopian so before

you look at what you are worth I killed

them for you I gave them the price of

those lives for you but who are you

Israel or did he do it for the Gentiles

think about it did he do it for the 10

tells the Bible is clear it is so clear

he says I gave them for Israel not for

the Christian Gentiles and why did he

give that for because I appreciate you

because I love you you are of great

value and I love you what's he talking

to Israel the Gentiles Israel Israel in

order to have you into

save your life I give up men and Nations

he says that which I gave up is nothing

for you Israel I give up the entire

world entirely

I give up the entire world what but in

her world are the who are they precisely

the Gentiles here he's Saint for Israel

I give up that Gentiles is not saying

since you Israel didn't want now I'm

gonna save the Gentiles in your place

he's saying all the contrary I kill

every Gentile for you Israel he says it

absolutely clear so then when the

Christians read theirs there and even

know what to explain and they say look

I've heard a pastor of all the ones that

I heard he says look look how great is

our Christ he says Yahweh gave up those

three nations for Israel Israel rejected

him but for us he gave his son this is

what's more valuable all those nations

for Israel or for that Yahweh himself

gave up his only begotten Son for us and

it was a WoW the Christians were left so

excited for Israel a couple fourth class

nations who cares about the Egyptians

destroy all that they're like that's

what Israel is worth but for us the

Gentiles Yahweh gave up his son and I

was like wow these guys really are

deceived right of course now they have

flipped the whole patty they say we'd

the Gentiles are more valuable than

Israel for Israel he gave up nations men

how easy it is to give up men but to

give up his only Son for me of course

they put it to you like that and you'll

think you're worth more than Israel

because if there's the comparison so

then I said oh no they will never

understand a thing absolutely nothing

for Israel yahwah give up himself

yahwah didn't send his son for the

gentiles Yahweh gave himself first he

killed the nation's he had to kill and

he saw that even sudden worked for his

it didn't work for Israel and he said I

will go myself because I got divorced I

will give my own life not for the

Gentiles but for Israel if some Gentile

Christian understands this and says I'm

no longer want to be a Christian because

Christian or Gentile takes me out of

salvation automatically when they say I

am a Gentile I am outside of the promise

out of all the promises except for

Paul's that's right what are the

Christians do eliminate the entire turn

off and keep Paul that is the

contradiction between Christianity and

the true religion found in the Tanakh

Yahweh himself gave his life for Israel

I'm gonna go ahead and read this in the

Jerusalem 2001 given that you are

precious in my eyes you are esteemed and

I love you not because you're good he

says why does yahwah love Israel if

Yahweh loved Israel because Israel's

good everything written here hasn't any

value first of all because his role was

always bad they were a hard-headed

nation Yahweh loves them because he

created them and he keeps what he

creates he is their Creator what's gonna

do create another nation no chance of

him creating another one so then he

loves what he created he created it and

he loves it before Israel demonstrates

love to him that is our promise why do

we love Yahweh because he loved us first

he loved us first before he designed us

and loved us it is not our obedience

what awakens love in Yahweh Yahweh loved

us before we were even obedient we were

always what disobedient so then when was

he going to fall in love with us never

out of our actions

never so then yahwah had the lovers

way before our actions he loves us way

before our actions he says I shall place

humanity in your place all of humanity

here he said the price of Israel's worth

how much is this worth the entire

humanity and that human leader heard the

Christians the Arabs the pagans the

worshipers of dragons all of humanity it

is Israel against humanity as simple as

that

if I'm Christian I'm humanity if I'm

pagan and humanity if I am a follower of

Allah I'm humanity the only ones that

are for Yahweh are Israel period the

only ones that's why it says I shall

give up humanity in your place in the

nations in ransom of your life of your

life that is the value of Israel in the

eyes of Yahweh

that's why yahwah is so jealous you see

yah was not jealous of the Christians

yah was not jealous of the pagans since

they're not his people he cannot be

jealous of what is not his but of Israel

he is jealous because he created them

every Israelite was created by him and

if your Israelite is loved by him that's

what he's so jealous

and that's why punishment is so harsh

for Israel I'll reap this because this

text is very impressive Isaiah 43 for in

the book of the people of God Spanish

LPD version for you are of great price

in mine eyes for you are valuable and I

love you I give up men in exchange for

you and Nations

in exchange for your life clearer than

that

impossible 5 fear not for I am with you

and I highlight the word I not we but I

not my father and I know not I the

father and the Holy Ghost

no I I only I I am with you fear not

from the east and from the west shall I

bring back your offspring to gather them

I shall say unto the north give them up

a command of yahwah's I shall say to the

north give them up into the south do not

withhold bring my sons and my daughters

or the children of Yahweh Israel and

here it includes the women to the same

level it is written in masculine and in

feminine he could have only said it is

necessary to bring back my children and

that covers all but clearly in the

original it says bring back my sons and

my daughters from afar from the ends of

the earth where did we the Israelites

end up and we are now in the ends of the

world in comparison to Israel always

compare with the geographical zones of

Israel where are we now the sons and

daughters we would be wayfarer exactly

we are the West right there we are the

west north as well we fit in north as

well a little bit to the north-northwest

both things but here it is clear that

Yahweh mentions both sexes the same sons

and daughters and he says I will bring

them from the ends of the earth look at

her reads into Jerusalem 2001 I shall

send to the North give them to me and to

the south do not withhold them I shall

bring my sons from afar and my daughters

from the ends of the earth

Elohim places in the same level of

importance both the masculine sexes as

well as the feminine sexes because

Israel are the only children he has he

has no more children 7 in fact Israel is

the only begotten son of Yahweh the only

begotten son of Yahweh 7 everyone who is

called by my name what is the name

Yahweh everyone who is called

by my name whom I created and formed yah

was the creator and the farmer of Israel

those whom I made for my own glory in

the end of it all why did he make Israel

for his glory so hang how could the

Gentiles be for the glory of him if they

were not made for his glory

Israel was designed was made and formed

for the glory of Elohim and they bear my

name I was surprised that the Christian

said this would seem to be talking about

Israel but it is actually talking about

us because they said we bear the name of

Christians Christ who is part of the

Trinity we bear his name so then we're

all in this promise here they haven't

understood a thing it's only talking

about Israel they bear the name of

Yahweh Yahweh he says everyone who's

everyone all the Israelites that bear my

name whom I created informed that is

where he tells it to you clearly it is

not the Gentiles but rather is Rael I'll

read this in the Jerusalem 2001 all who

are called by my name whom for my glory

I created plaz made it and made Wow what

an impressive prophecy which is a

prophecy and a message if we have to

comprehend who we are who are we we are

the light of the world

Israel is the light of the world the

menorah as a red today our oil is going

down on it by the way the menara is the

light of the world the Christians say

Jesus is the light of the world and I

tell you no Israel is the light of the

world because Yeshua is Israelite and

when he came he said I am the light of

the world

Israel's the light of the world you are

the light of the world not the Gentiles

Israel a

bring well and before you get dizzy

because maybe in your mind you had a

short-circuit

what do you mean is Russell out of the

world and you should not the light of

the world no because Israel is the light

of the world

as you'll understand even more later on

for there who are in charge of making

Yahweh beknownst into the world if they

are in charge if we as Israelites are in

charge of making Yahweh be known into

the world who is the light that came

into the world Israel because Yeshua

does not illuminate the world because if

you're sure were to illuminate the world

then white won't Israel why do want the

Torah if your she was gonna be preaching

every Sunday at the churches Yeshua put

in church as light of the world he is

the light totally I'm not saying it's

not

yah was the light but he charged Israel

to illuminate with their light in other

words Israel bears the light of Yeshua

or of Yahweh to the world obviously

today's Israel does not bear the light

of the world we bear it and we are

telling the world as witnesses as

witnesses that Yahweh came to earth

under the name of Yeshua that is to give

testimony unto the world of who you sure

is who is Yahweh eight bring out my

people who have eyes yet are blind and

have ears yet her death he's speaking

about us and what I understand may have

other applications I won't say he

doesn't speaking to us how us as

Israelites created by Elohim how are we

from atomic go on blind absolutely blind

we had ears of course but that it does

any good we were deaf

absolutely deaf and yahoo says bring

that people that people of mine bring it

they are blind in their death that's

fine but I will open their ears

and open their eyes nine gather together

all the nations assemble yourselves you

nation so I'll stop a second here that's

why when we see in someone it could be a

member of the eternal truth or not that

they start with an inclination towards

for example the Indians the Native

Americans let's use that example and

that the great Wiseman of the Native

Americans predicted all those which men

but the wisdom of the Indians is the

wisdom of a zazul all the peoples of the

world are directed by a suzelle all of

them no exception

there is one saw people in which Elohim

revealed himself and was accompanied by

him and made himself be known to them

that peoples called Israel the rest the

rest entirely it could be in Japan in

Asia in China in Germania in America in

any place there could be peoples who

have a communication with the other side

peoples who speak to suppose at God's

peoples who speak with advanced men in

wisdom every one of them never spoke

with Yahweh who were they speaking to

with fallen angels azo and or and or

Nephilim there were bloody peoples who

would kill and kill and would sacrifice

to please those gods not front moment

should you imagine that humans worship

something because they felt like it out

of their own imagination they are guided

by these entities we are not alone so

then a people who is not directed by

Yahweh

is guided by other entities that is very

clear no matter if the people are bloody

or the people are not bloody that

doesn't matter but there are different

angels and different tendencies but

either way it all gives us the same

result who directed those peoples no

matter how much wisdom they had who

taught them the art of war to all the

Orientals who taught the art in the cuts

of the roots for witchcraft every one of

those things was not about Yahweh it was

taught by different entities who are

contrary to Yahweh they could be fallen

angels ages are himself or Nephilim

those three types there are some are

pacifiers who don't sacrifice and others

are bloody who desire sacrifices it

depends what entity is guiding that

people and sometimes they would fight

amongst the peoples because the entities

fight don't think if the children of a

Lehane fight amongst themselves

just imagine the entities who have not

an authority above the Meuse eloheem

they all hate each other there are

groups of angels and also Nephilim who

hate each other

never forget that they killed each other

because according to the book of enoch

gabriel came along and gave them a sword

and it says that they killed each other

don't think that from hate now they're

all friends amongst them all the

Nephilim party together they celebrate

the birthdays of one or the other do you

remember almost 3,000 years ago when we

were alive then you killed me well now

you're gonna see as it turns out I just

remembered why you wicked I'd be alive

if it wasn't for you who went and killed

me I wanted to keep my body they hate

each other they did test themselves

that's why the wars amongst the peoples

they would kill each other they are

guided by different entities do you

follow none by Yahweh so then when I

suppose it is réalité

they start to turn towards them and say

what great wisdom here from this great

chief see dat horse Redskins

I mean I don't know a galloping horse

giant feet saying what great wisdom of

his that is paganism but more than

paganism it is an aggression which is

unforgivable until yo it I want to be

very clear it's unforgivable

because that is to look for other Elohim

who are not Yahweh there is no wisdom

whatsoever in the Indians there is no

wisdom whatsoever in the peoples let us

do with religion worship there is no

prophecy whatsoever in the Indians

mapache WAP a Redskins or however the

heck they're called

that are true a Styx mind some of the

rest there is no true prophecy in them

every single one of them are guided by

fallen angels asel himself or Nephilim

and amongst themselves they fight

amongst themselves they fight to the

death

and since they can't kill each other

they're like my people will tear your

people to pieces just like the soccer

teams you see soccer teams what's

produced is hate that is not

understandable amongst Argentinians

themselves amongst the families family

fits well there themselves some are from

Boca some are from River Plate but when

it's game day they want to kill each

other it's a rational that rationality

is what happens in the fallen angels

it's irrational so then if I have a

people will that I have fallen angel or

a Nephilim guides a people and they'll

worship Him he possesses them all he has

sex with all of them because they get

into everybody's bodies do you

understand

he eats at all then another Nephilim

comes over who is precisely the one who

killed him for example and he has

another people there and they hate each

other and what's gonna happen with those

peoples they're gonna kill each other

kill each other because they hate

amongst their leaders their leaders

can't

kill each other but their subjects can

kill each other but what's important is

this there's only one people who has the

glory of the only true Elohim that

people's Israel where either Israel or

we are guided by the Fallen Angels

gather together all you nations assemble

all ye peoples who among them had

predicted this yah was saying does

anyone in those nations have a true

prediction none so then if you publish

this prophecy was given by this

that is completely contrary to what

Yahweh says about Israel who amongst

them had predicted this or had announced

former things let them bring their

witnesses to prove them right and let

them hear and say that it is true there

is not a soul witness there isn't

absolutely anything it is all vanity

except for Israel the New Living

Translation says Isaiah 43 9 gather the

nations together all the nations gather

together assemble all the peoples of the

world how many all of them which of

their idols has ever foretold such

things which can predict what will

happen tomorrow the fallen angels cannot

predict what will happen tomorrow except

if they have a plan and if they say

tomorrow that house will burn down and

they come and set it on fire and then

let you see house right but what is

actually gonna happen they do not know

anything I can also predict with

precision exact things and then I go and

do them I make them happens whatever it

costs me so then I am the great

visionary prophet no I'm a liar that I

predict something and then I go and do

it all I can predict is I'm gonna make I

don't know some delicious pizzas and

maybe if Elohim gives Avella him gives

me life I'll make you some delicious

pizzas that does not make me a prophet

makes you get pizza maker but if I were

to say Danilo

gonna make some pizzas that we've never

tasted before then that'd be the worst

of liars okay that was just a joke but

if we were to help him if we helped them

to make them of course he's gonna make

some good pizzas then I can say you see

how I'm right then I'm a great prophet i

prophesy something that's never happened

before and then a little maid as the

best pizzas ever made Wow Wow

that's what's called cheating in English

cheating cheating cheating that's all

you ever says gather the nations of the

world in the nations which of your idols

and let it be known that within every

Idol there is a demon don't think that

men would just make an idol a hollow

Idol that man would just imagine no no

no those idols were guided by spiritual

entities I'm gonna tell you once again

it surprises me but the scriptures I'm

not gonna read you the text the

scriptures say you went and worshiped

reptiles if we are guilty of going to

worship the reptiles the reptiles are

not born out of the imagination of men

that is why in China and all of the

Orient worship helm the Dragons what are

the dragons reptiles that's what the

Indians of America worship home the

feathered serpents who are what dragons

and you'll see that every every nation

Babylon home that they worship Bell

who's Bell another dragon another dragon

southern every one every one of the

peoples worship what reptiles I was I'll

tell you this again I was around four or

five years old I had never watched

television there was another radio at my

house I didn't read any comic books

because I didn't know how to read yet my

mom would not tell me stories neither

any stories that are conspiracies

nothing all they read to me at that time

was the Bible all day or the beautiful

stories of the Bible

that's all I would get I didn't go to

school yet I didn't have non-adventist

friends I lived at home I was four or

five years old and for many nights what

do you think would appear to me reptiles

I saw them I saw him with my own eyes

reptiles and angels would come and take

out those reptiles but where could my

imagination do you think my imagination

could have seen with the Chinese see the

Americans those of Babylon all the

people see reptiles where does that come

from what is that a common brain wave

that we all the humans have no no

because the reptiles who are all these

individuals have mentioned fallen angels

Aizaz el who's a reptile himself and the

Nephilim are or what reptilians that is

why precisely the worship of the peoples

is not an imagination of the peoples but

are rather guided by these entities

southern but it is all about the dragon

everything you see now is the dragon

dragon dragon dragon dragons all over

the place absolutely from every where

you see dragons I'll read from the NIDA

Living Translation it says gather gather

ye nations assemble the peoples of the

world which of their idols are those

that are guided by the reptilians has

ever foretold such things which of then

can predict what will happen tomorrow

because just because we don't see them

that doesn't mean that they are

intelligent they are imbeciles all these

reptilians are they're imbeciles because

the Book of Enoch says you the secrets

you revealed which are not yours but of

heaven so then everything they revealed

what is not something they made up but

they brought it from heaven he says you

actually revealed secrets that are

insignificant compared with what is

actually true because they would teach

to the people to men all the wickedness

they had but what does he tell them you

revealed insignificant secrets so they

don't believe for a second that the

reptilians whether they're fallen angels

whether it's

Zozo himself or it's the rest of the

Nephilim are way too intelligent they

are idiots who have a lost battle and

with Israel they cannot mess except for

the Israelite to open their door if we

as Israelites mingle in their territory

then we're in great problems but as

Israelites if we love the Shema that

scheme' is not written only in our homes

it is written here and in the heart they

have no way of bothering us

why do you don't see dragons why not

because you cannot see them because they

cannot mess with you because that people

does not belong to them but why did the

Christians receive spiritual attacks all

the time and they say I am being

spiritually attacked demons appearing to

me all these things appear to me for

what reason

because they don't have Yahweh if they

had Yahweh they cannot access them and

if somebody is bothering you what is the

answer is because you don't have Yahweh

do you understand

the day you accept Yahweh you understand

Yahweh you baptize yourself in the name

which Yahweh used when he came to earth

everything you do you do in the name of

Yahweh those imbécile entities have no

power whatsoever in your life they have

no power those who surround you have

power that can make your life difficult

it's like the war amongst the peoples

you see but they directly over your

house they have no power unless you open

the door for them if you open the door

for them invite him in the only guilty

person is you it is not them it's not

that Yahweh stopped protecting you you

opened the door to those entities why

would they attack me as a child because

I had to see them or else I wouldn't

believe him a thing I don't believe in

miracles I don't believe in anything you

tell me I had a miracle I'm angel

appeared unto me I'm not gonna believe

you I'll listen to you I'm not gonna

believe you because there's no reason

whatsoever so then it's not that they

would attack me they couldn't touch me I

would see them as in a vision which is

very different they would

even touch me I would see them it's as

if they wanted to launch themselves to

where I was but they could not touch me

they would just fly around above me at

ceiling level until angels would come

and take him out it was impressive

I had to see them to believe or else I

don't believe a thing

I don't believe a thing so then let's go

I'll continue text it says which of your

idols has ever predicted such things

which of them can predict what will

happen tomorrow where are the witnesses

of such predictions who can prove that

they have spoken true 10 Yahweh our

firms you are my witnesses this is the

text that the Jehovah's Witnesses used

but the Jehovah's Witnesses are not

Israel they consider themselves to be

what Gentiles southern they've got a

great contradiction soon it will click

in their mind that they were not

Jehovah's Witnesses but ASA sells

witnesses because they do not comprehend

and they acquired this commandment of

being a witness of Jehovah as they say

for themselves when never could a

Gentile ever be a witness of Yahweh but

only Israel but here Yahweh affirms you

is rael are my witnesses My servants

whom I have chosen that you may know me

and trust me and understand who I am

Sullivan this text that is absolutely

marvelous Yahweh affirms that Israel is

the only witness unto the world that

Yahweh exists that Yahweh created Israel

that Israel are the servants of Yahweh

in that sense well said until those

servants become the wife that Israel was

chosen

that they know Yahweh that they trust in

me he says not in us he says and

understand who I am so then all the rest

of the peoples can they understand who

y'all was yahwah himself affirms it

I don't affirm it if you're not an

Israelite you have not the capacity we

understand who Yahweh's instance you

don't have the capacity of understand

who you is you think that yah were three

different people the father son Holy

Spirit three different beings every one

has its own role but there are three

beings who are different only Israel can

understand who is Yahweh and why can

they understand it it is clear because

he gave the law to Israel he told me who

he was and how many they were how many

were they one only one and it fills one

Israel if there's something that Israel

has clear is that how many Elohim mother

one absolutely just one in here he says

it when the Christians read this they

pass over and do not explain it before

me this y'all was speaking not before us

before me now Elohim has ever existed

and this is a bad translation I'm about

to tell you what it literally says word

by word which even the Hebrews

themselves tell you this is a bad

translation before me no Elohim existed

that's a bad translation and it can be

misinterpreted but I read it as is

before me no Elohim existed nor shall

there be any after me that's very

important because if there's no I love

him after him he cannot first reveal

himself I am Yahweh and then in time he

says he always sent his son he clearly

closed the circle here he says no one

before me no one after me I'm the only

one unique no one else unique only one

understand at Israel understand it no

one before me no one after me I'm not

gonna send anyone else and give my glory

to anyone saying this is my beloved son

no you're my beloved children you

have only one father and that's me

before me there's no other Elohim after

me there is no other Elohim you will not

know another Elohim I'm the only one

absolutely unique for that same reason

is Christendom absolutely governed by

other beings because they have only one

a time now they have one government of

three Elohim look at how it says in the

Jerusalem which is absolutely better

isaiah 43:10 jerusalem 2001 ye israel

are my witnesses word of yahweh and my

servant whom I have chosen that my

servant is singular but it is Israel in

singular it's that one sole person

Christians say here and my servant oh

that's that's Jesus

you see Yahweh with the Israelites and

also my servant my servant that I will

send it is not Jesus of Christianity it

is not Yeshua he's talking about is Rael

he says you are my witnesses my servant

Israel whom I have chosen that you may

know me and believe me myself that's

what it says originally myself it

doesn't say us it's as myself once all

person and understand that I am and

eases the word I am that's why when you

sure came don't you understand that I am

he told them the message there when

Yeshua says I am he's saying I am Yahweh

that's what he's saying not that I am

like I'm a macho we say I am Christian I

am I don't know American Argentinian

Mexican South durian whatever

when yahwah says i am is that i am

yahweh when you show says I am that ye

understand that I am what his aim is I

am yahwah the only one that exists there

isn't another there isn't absolutely

another it is very important in order to

understand all the chapters of john that

were reading

then you get John 17 in the prayer and

everybody loses their head there there

it is two beings

you sure speaking to his father and to

top it off he says you are the only true

Elohim and Jesus Christ whom you have

sent there you have the two clearly but

hold on you should just set right there

that he's not Elohim he says you are the

only true Elohim and Yeshua no longer

being the one true eloheem whom you have

sent

I'm the God sent you are the only one to

Herlihy me it's all part of the parable

but we're gonna have to study that once

we touch John 17

but in that but in that point of the

parable this is the mind of all the

Gentiles closed just like that a weird

Gentile if you are earning at this

moment saying I see two there that's

because you're still a Gentile until you

become an Israelite because the first

thing that an Israelite must suck on

along with his mother's milk is the

Shema that's how true Israelite is born

and are told baby girl baby boy you have

only one Elohim how many are there how

many fingers do you see

and I better use this finger how many

fingers do you see there like one one

one finger Christian see how many

fingers do you see baby three they show

him from childhood why you're all

laughing I'm not kidding here from

childhood they are baptised in the name

of the Father Son Holy Spirit from

childhood they are given a cookie cutter

3 a Jew from childhood he's given one

just like that one the one brand and

they've already asked me and jumped

ahead and they were like but in John 14

it says that precisely the 144,000 are

with the issuer in the heavenly City and

that in their foreheads they have the

name of Yeshua and of his father I've

already explained that long ago why

don't you pay attention I don't

understand why you don't pay attention

the original does not say the name of

Yeshua of his father but rather it says

of his father only it's been added in

the Spanish RV 1960 and of his father

but it doesn't say end of his father but

rather they have the name of his father

only once

named before of course when we used to

believe that there were two divine

beings we used to say his name in doubt

of his father's so then it used to say

here

Yahweh Yeshua and the New Jerusalem it

isn't so there's only one name that

would break if we had been choose right

there we would break that part because

if we've got the mark of one no one can

take away that mark it has to be branded

by finest but not just because of the

Shema it's all the prophets that are

telling you look what it says here you

are my witnesses that you know me and

believe me and understand that I am one

alone before I'm reading The Jerusalem

2001 before me here it is well

translated now the one that is one alone

is saying he's about to explain to you

in case you haven't understood if you

think that there will be a new

revelation no but for him there was

another and we have to accept them as

well

now after him there would be another it

is not revealed Jesus comes after and

after Jesus there's another that comes

out it is also not revealed who's called

the Holy Spirit and at the end we're

three and then some broad lmg white will

come to you have to accept ours as well

and then another idiot Paul you have to

accept them as well you have to accept

all of them as well no it says that you

believe me myself and understand that I

am before me look at me says Yahweh I'm

the only one before me before you form

strange ideas before me there was no

other Elohim formed and the words are

exact no Elohim was formed wait how's

y'all gonna say no other Elohim was

formed that is what the text textually

says every word in the Hebrew no other

Elohim has been formed right there he's

telling us many things he's telling us

that he is a formed eloheem formed is

the same word as begotten I can use

begotten there before me no other Lehane

has been begotten but there's a problem

there because of the word other if we

were to say before me no Elohim was

begotten but already with the before me

he's sane of what is clear to understand

unless you don't understand it that

yahwah is saying that he is begotten and

there is no one like him there's no one

else begotten it says it to say my

father before me had no other son before

me my wife didn't marry another nor will

she marry again after me right there it

is clearly understood that I am the

husband of my wife before me my dad had

no other son nor will he have another

son after me but I'm telling you that

I'm a son are you following the textual

word says I am understanded Israel that

I am before me nan was formed none was

begotten not another eloheem nor after

me will there be any period the factory

is closed here there's nothing more to

see here just like that nothing more and

the Hebrews who understand that that in

commodity of not other was formed no

other was formed the phrase says if no

one else was formed that means he was

formed do you follow no one else was

formed I'm the only one formed there

isn't anyone else that has been formed

the Israelites explained well well he's

actually saying is that there's never

been an Elohim that's been formed but

they understand that yahwah is

explaining there that he was formed are

you following me or I'll see that too

that's what the New Living Translation

is incorrect I'll go ahead and read it

again it says before me no Elohim has

existed the translation is absolutely

incorrect right there that's not what

the original says if it said it that way

that's fine

I'd accepted whatever yahwah says he

says but what's originally written with

which the Hebrews have a problem is that

he says I am before me no Elohim was

formed nor will there be after me period

that is the central message of today

before me no other Elohim was formed no

will there be one formed after me so I

don't have children

that's what he's saying I don't have

brothers I don't have

sons and have brothers nor will I ever

have sons and brothers that are eloheem

my only son is Israel so then okay

Elohim who was formed by other Elohim it

is clearer and better sheet whether you

like it or not but those other Elohim

have nothing to do with this absolutely

nothing to do because it's the creation

of our Elohim of our Elohim he says I am

alone whatever there is behind that's

not your business you do not worship it

it is not your husband it's nothing of

yours this here which I made for you is

mine Israel is mine and all of the earth

is mine and I'll make it again and I

want you to understand something that I

only am I alone and that before me no

other as I was formed nor after me will

there be anybody phoned like I am I am

unique and always would I be the only

one I am that is the clear message it is

absolutely clear marvelous and we Israel

have been called to be his witnesses

that's what's marvelous you're a witness

every Israelite has the same value

before Yahweh same worth both the

speaker as well as the receiver of the

news you are now his witnesses because

y'all was said so every one of you are

his witnesses every one of you has been

chosen by Yahweh to be born and to bear

this message which is the light of the

world it is the light of the world it is

not I but rather it is every one of us

who are the witnesses what are we a

witness of that there is only one Elohim

and against whom up we witnesses against

the whole world all the nations who are

called Gentiles the Gentiles have

whatever except one sole eloheem in if

they do have one solo name like the

Muslims they have the wrong a loin is

called differently

it's called Allah not Yahweh and they

don't understand a thing because the

Muslims the herbs are not the chosen

people the only created people who have

been formed by Yahweh or Israel he

called her father Abraham out of Babylon

brought him to this land changed his

name change the name to Sarah put in the

age which

the hay which is which belongs to Elohim

he added that word I mean that letter in

his name in order to tell him you no

longer are what you were before Knight

you're something else not you're someone

else different person that I took out of

Babylon those two were not the people of

Elohim not Abraham not Sarah were the

people of Elohim but from then on Elohim

forms his people out of zero he does not

use anything secondhand from scratch

that's why he changes the name before

they have children he changes the name

to both of them not just one both of

them he creates a new person among the

two Sarah had never had children because

her womb was dried because it was born

dried because she had to be a virgin in

the production of the children that was

to be born

yahwah was creating a people from

scratch absolutely from scratch and

didn't choose anyone he chose the

parents to create what he wanted in the

moment that he wanted he gave that

uterus life he rejuvenated Sarah and

Sarah was like what am I gonna have

pleasure with my Lord at this age yes

that this age will have pleasure you'll

not just have pleasure you'll have a son

that son was called Isaac and Isaac

begat and had Jacob and Esau Esau has

nothing to do with the promise it was

told to the mother before the son that I

am choosing his name is Jacob and Jacob

is born and yahwah does not like the

name Jacob is not that he doesn't like

it he chose it as well but he changed it

as well so that he understands that he's

a new nation which he named and yahwah

told them you will no longer be called

Jacob you shall be called Israel at that

moment that he changes his name it

creates a new a new person by the name

of Israel Israel marries four women

whether you like it or not none of those

four women he begets his 12 children

that's where you get 12 tribes of Israel

tell me what part did yahwah choose if

he created everything from scratch

absolutely from scratch and from there

are we the descendants once we

understand and value who we are on this

earth we are the direct children

of Elohim absolutely from Elohim we're

not just cheddar oh yeah we're children

no he put us in church that as children

we have to be what what witnesses

witnesses which is the light to carry

the light to the ignorant Gentiles but

not so the Gentiles imitators but rather

in all cases if they are interested in

our Elohim the only eloheem that exists

whose name is Yahweh for them to be a

part of the people of Israel not for

them to open up a new religion was

called Christians but for them to become

Israelite that is the only light that we

can give we cannot say the light is to

say that yah yah will accept you you

have to keep Shabbat you have to keep a

thing come as you are he'll accept you

but you have to accept Christ that is

not the message the message is to beat

what witnesses of Yahweh notice he says

you're my witnesses you sure it's not

saying be you witnesses of Yeshua

but be witnesses of home of Yahweh when

we are witnesses of Yahweh and we

understand that we're Israelite and we

understand that we've got once all

eloheem recorded in our mind it is

barely then when we start to comprehend

that the one who came to earth who had

himself be called the son of Elohim

wasn't another but rather it was Elohim

himself but that is the deepest truth

that Elohim has given us to be known but

he has made it be known to us when we

made us understand that we are that were

not Christians look at the things he

made us abandon when I said I am no

longer a Christian and the eternal truth

is that Christian most people had a

heart attack

what we're not Christians but your name

is greased in and we're not Christian

and we're not Christian no we're not

Christian we're not Christian we're

we're also not Jewish neither are we of

the Jewish religion we are is why lights

instance we're Israelites we have Elohim

on our site and Elohim did not promise

No

problems on us no he says you're gonna

be drowning in the river you're gonna be

burning and set the fire but I'll go

ahead and save you because I'm with you

don't you worry I do not promise that

you'll have a life the color pink and

because you accepted me now you will

live without any problems this is now

did you accept me now I'm gonna send you

all kinds of pumps in fact I'll could

read your text says you want to keep the

commandments get ready to get ready to

really demonstrate in your own life what

you're saying is true get ready for the

test you want to be faithful to eloheem

get ready for the test that is when

it'll him promises us if he were to

promises alive the color of pink we

would not get to be the type of people

that'll him wants us to be he wants us

to experience all kinds of problems

first to be drowning in the water for us

to be burning with all the problems that

coming the world but that we know that

Elohim sent that and that he wants us to

understand that he is there with us that

is the greatest promise that we as

Israelites can enjoy you are my

witnesses and literally in Hebrew says

before me no other Elohim was formed and

after me none shall exist that's what it

says literally after me what's it say

none will exist so then when someone

says I am the son of Yahweh oh you're

the son of Yahweh what are you Israel no

no I'm the son of Yahweh you're the son

of Yahweh Yahweh has no son the only son

he has is Israel and if someone comes

here and says I am the son of Yahweh

right at the moment in which L had

prophesized that the son of righteous

just had to show up at the moment in

which our way ed said that the Messiah

had to show up when we notice these

prophecies where it says I am your only

Savior Israel when the Savior appears so

then who could it be the son of Yahweh

no it's Yahweh himself who serves to

make himself be understood within the

parable he made himself be called the

son of Yahweh but he made it very clear

that he was yo

absolutely yowee so then if it literally

says after Yahweh none shall exist can

yahwah have a son with the same power

and that can save no no cuz yahwah said

after me no one shall exist I am the

only Elohim can yahwah send a son in

this place no can to exist for Israel

father and son absolutely not

just like that no never ever for us as

Israel because we are Israelite will

there be another eloheem except for

Yahweh for all eternity

the only eloheem it's listen o Israel

Yahweh our Elohim Yahweh's one alone

Yahweh always was one alone and will

always be one alone there will never be

for Israel

another eloheem before Yahweh nor will

there be for Israel another Lehane after

Yahweh its yahwah and only Yahweh only

i.m and as it turns out he are my

witnesses the word of Yahweh and my

servant whom I have chosen the

Christians are when they say my servant

is his Jesus let us go to Isaiah 41

eight through nine where he made it very

clear who the servant of Yahweh is

Isaiah 41 8 through nine Jerusalem 2001

reads as follows

but thou the to get there already Isaiah

41 eight through nine but thou Israel

he's speaking and singular for the

entire people thou Israel my servant who

is Israel my servant Jacob whom I have

chosen

the seed of Abraham my friend how nice

the way it is translated here and the

seed of Abraham my friend

to whom I have taken from the ends of

the earth and called me from the chief

man thereof and said unto thee my

servant art thou who is the servant of

Yahweh who is it Israel who is the light

of the world Israel who are the

witnesses of the world Israel nothing to

do with the Jehovah's Witnesses that

Jehovah's Witnesses are Israel the

religion that calls themselves jealous

witnesses are a Pauline religion that

doesn't understand absolutely anybody

anything it's tough enough they deny

that Jesus is Yahweh Jesus is being an

inferior God absolutely inferior to

Yahweh you've got Yahweh and then you've

got Jesus so how much truth have they

got first of all they're denying the

very text that gives them their name

because of Yahweh if they really

believed in Yahweh as their only eloheem

they could not say that Jesus is a minor

God

there isn't a minor God there's nothing

after Yahweh are you following this if

you ask yourselves witness who is Jesus

they would tell you yeah it's got a

minor God a created God what do you mean

a created God if you're it's just that

never again will there be a God created

that no one will exist after him the

very same text that gave them their name

they deny it

because the text says no one exists

after Yahweh so then if you're sure is

not Yahweh then Yeshua is nothing the

very own text destroys everything they

believe him

they are nothing but thieves and frauds

of the name of Israel because the only

one who is a witness to the world that

Yahoo is yahwah and that yahwah is one

and then yahwah is the only true him is

Israel it is not these wretched

Jehovah's Witnesses aside from fact that

they're turnit Arian in aside from they

will be guilty of theft because they

think they are the witnesses the proud

witnesses of Jehovah when they're

actually witnesses of a zsuzsa there

so they really are witnesses of it's

just that they stole the name others who

stole the name just like Israel did who

are now there they're not really

Israelite and they really do not worship

Yahweh they worship Yahweh but they

don't accept Yahweh it worship Yahweh

but they don't accept Yahweh because

they worship the Yahweh from the Tanakh

but when yahwah came they rejected him

so then they continued to worship Yahweh

not knowing that when they rejected

yahwah when he came they were left

without the Yahweh they worship so no

matter how much they worship Yahweh says

they didn't accept Yahweh they have not

Yahweh it's as simple as that absolutely

as simple as that and it's not that they

know not that yahwah came every Orthodox

Jew knows one ben yosef that's him they

insult they say that it's the son of the

prostitute of a Jewish prostitute with a

general or a soldier of the Romans so

then of course they know the story are

they not gonna know it if it was

Christians themselves who formed their

state they didn't form the state

themselves the Christian nations called

the UN they gave them the place so then

if there's somebody they should be

thankful to they have to be grateful to

Christianity and the other Christian who

gave them all their support and their

capital

his name is trumped by the way he is not

Jewish his Christian so then when they

filled our mouths to say we're such

Friends of the United States the u.s. is

a Christian nation so then the ones who

gave them the power are the Christians

they cannot say we didn't know that a

Christ existed I did you not know if

they even formed your state they give

you the power they gave you the weapons

they give you everything their

signatures even their capital to give

you everything absolutely everything so

then in rejecting Yahweh they're left

without Yahweh 11 and I can already see

that we're gonna study I told you that

this chapter was marvelous I told you

this chapter is absolutely

marvelous I think that due to the time

we're gonna be once again be left

without John 16 we're barely halfway

through the chapter I'm gonna follow

eleven but please pay attention how can

turn a Terran Christian ISM exist if he

says only I am Yahweh how many does he

say it is only i but all done if he says

only i and after me no one else was

formed and after me not another will be

formed it is only I where do we get

three tell me where do get three where

do we get two

I understand that he has a father but we

include the father in this government

and he said not to include him don't

include him it is only I I am in charge

here

I am the only one for you so then he

says I only I only I am Yahweh outside

of me no one can save what part of that

did not understand so then how do the

Christians say got Yahweh but we've also

got our Savior whose name is jaysus

because they the Christians never say

that the father saved who saves Jesus

but Jesus since he saves he can't be

with you he sends another what's his

name the Holy Spirit and those three are

the government of the Trinity and he

says only I am Yahweh and besides me

there is no Savior I'll read it in The

Jerusalem 2001 I I am Yahweh and here it

is and here is literal I remember a read

of the Jewish Wiseman here is literal he

says I I am Yahweh he says do you know

what the Jews say here they say here

Elohim apparently wants to be more

explicit because it is more marked than

in the commandments of themselves you

see how in the commandments he says I am

Yahweh who took you out of London Egypt

but here it says here it says for some

reason to take us out of any thought

that there is more than one he repeats

in the original twice the word I I come

I am yahwah he doesn't say i comma we

are Yahweh he didn't say we and I are

Yahweh he repeats it twice and the Jews

highlight this by saying this is rather

redundant but we're talking redundant as

if it were out of place but there is a

message that's very important

wouldja was recording in you saying I I

no one else I I M Yahweh and besides me

there is no Savior it's over outside of

me there is no Savior

so then how could you always send this

on to save tell me how how can you a

send a prophet to save he cannot send a

prophet SAV

the only Savior is who Yahweh thought

ERISA matt says I am I am Yahweh he

repeats the I am I am Yahweh and there

is no other Savior outside of me Spanish

LPD version the book of the people of

God I only I am Yahweh how many yahwah's

rather than we used to think before the

door to Yahweh's Gambetta bore and all

the Adventist theologians say that there

are two yahwah's and the spirit here

yahwah directly tells you but of course

they are Christians can they understand

if you're Christian as long as you have

the title of Christianity here or a

Christian it is not a lot for you to

understand this that is why we did not

understand this until we got rid of the

Christian title when we said where are

we

I'm not a Christian I'm no longer a

Christian I'm an Israelite whether you

like it or not now have somebody that

speaks Hebrew comes and says you're not

an Israelite and you can go to hell what

do I care what you say or not I am an

Israelite because yahwah has made me

understand that I'm an Israelite later

we'll see whether you who speaks Hebrew

were really an Israelite and I believe

not absolutely not

we're in the same situation as some who

come and all they're missing is the

feather you understand one

saying they're missing the feather and

they speak to you nothing but English

I'm an American they say don't you speak

Spanish nope nothing have I to do with

the Latinos but I'm telling you all he

needs is a bow and arrow and a feather

and he'd be complete same thing you have

to see these who speak Hebrew who claim

to be Jewish according to the scriptures

in many chapters it says that precisely

those who say they are Jews and are not

but rather they lie are the synagogue of

Ages L Yahweh says I'm not saying it

it's in Revelation he says that people

who says they're Jews are not they are

actually what the synagogue of Aces oh

that is what it says I'm gonna make them

come and bow before you at your feet it

is an expression of saying well in the

end of it all we weren't no you're not

and why weren't they they would have

been if they would have accepted Yahweh

they would have been if they had

accepted Yahweh because I'll tell you

what it is not necessary for the

Israelite to come from the Israelite

blood it isn't necessary because those

who had the Israelite blood who said we

are the sons of Abraham Yeshua clearly

knowing that they were direct children

of Abraham he tell them you are not

children of Abraham but rather are

children of a zazul your father if you

were children of Abraham which they were

were they or not of course they were but

you sure contradicts that they were he

says you are not wait

they had a direct lineage from Abraham

but you sure says you are not so then

who are they those who are are those who

accept me because he says Abraham

rejoiced in my day cuz he saw my day you

are not even if you say you are even if

your papers say you are even if your DNA

says that you are even if you can follow

your genealogy up to Abraham you are not

just you sure what do you mean they're

not if my great-great-grandfather was

Abraham no no your

great-great-grandfather was a suzelle

who said that did I

you sure did so then if you change that

if the very

with papers in the Land of Israel he

tells them you are not Israelite then

those who really accept Abraham as their

father make themself be called Israelite

not Christian then it's the same thing

they can say but we're not we don't have

the blood of Abraham you sure says don't

you worry your father is Abraham their

father is a suzelle it's as simple as

that

so don't do a DNA test see view or not

don't you worry whether you have a

different face to how they look don't

you worry about the color of your skin

you could be darker than the darkest

night that makes no difference

whatsoever if your heart accept

Yahweh as your only Elohim and you

understand what it is to be an Israelite

you are absolutely more of an Israelite

than what they could ever be ever so

then it doesn't depend or where we were

born or would are we it depends of how

we were called we were called to be

Israelite only I am Yahweh there is no

other Yahweh and there is no Savior

outside of me can there be another

Savior can you always send another

Savior no no what is the problem of the

Christians and of the world what is the

problem with them exactly two problems

they know not the power of Yahweh and

they know not the Scriptures that is the

only little problem they know not the

power of Yahweh and they know not the

Scriptures the scriptures say there is

none other than me it is only me alone

before me there was no one after me

there won't be anybody there is the

other Savior how much more clear though

I have say this is there anything

missing here the only thing left to say

is that but what are you not

understanding if you only have two brain

cells and one of them you have to

understand that I've told you that is

one alone if someone tells you there are

2 there 3 it is not true I myself I'm

telling you I am alone Yahweh there is

no other Savior someone it comes to save

Ian says I'm the Savior I am there is no

Savior

it's either Yahweh or there

no Savior there's a deceiver once all

Savior Yahweh whatever other Savior

deceiver so then if someone wants to say

oh yahwah has a son who's the savior no

yahoo has no son who's the savior Yahweh

is directly the savior and when he came

he made himself be called Yahshua

because he could not make himself be

called Yahweh he is the only Savior

there is and outside of me there is no

Savior so then who is the savior jesus

christ of the turns here and christians

who is it a deceiver a deceiver jesus

christ the savior of the Trinitarians is

a deceiver in the doctrine once we

understand who Yeshua is when we

understand he is Yahweh that is where we

understand the truth and the truth shall

make us free free from Christian lies to

understand this we've got to declare

face-first into the world as witnesses

of Yahweh I am NOT Christian what part

have you not understood I am NOT

Christian so then when one declares I am

NOT a Christian then Yahweh can reveal

his secret unto you and you can

understand it 12

but yahwah doesn't end there mind you

he's fixated on the idea of explaining

to his people that no other exists just

incas heaven or self because there's

always an idiot that they understand 12

says yahwah affirms that's for those who

have doubts we're struggling with the

father and the son but the father said

but this is my beloved Son in whom I am

well pleased

Kenya will not speak in two places at

the same time tell me can he or not of

course he can do so our problem is that

we know not the power of Yahweh and the

other one is that we know not the

Scriptures if the father comes along

speaking this is my beloved son where

did this guy come from

hold on a minute if this the one

speaking is Yahweh then this one's an

imposter a they are both Yahweh that

this is the son then you lied to me

Yahweh cuz you had a son

and you're saving me through this one

again you lied to me you said you were

the only Savior there's a problem here

until we understand that the one who

spoke is the same

Yahweh who is the same Yeshua whether

you like it or not maybe if you don't

like it

you always got Christianity available to

you they will embrace you saying with

their open arms and they're not

resentful and they'll forgive you

everything that you said against the

Trinity they'll forgive you and the

baptized you what and then they move the

Father the Son the Holy Spirit and you

become another brother of theirs but do

you want to know the truth we are

Israelite what are we I want you to

repeat this cuz you're not used to

saying what are you what are you it's

gotta be born from the heart what are

you an Israelite it's right no matter

what your face looks like if you look

more like something else

what am i an Israelite and if they look

at you weird hey you're not Israelite

that's your problem not mine I am an

Israelite absolutely an Israelite you

have to have it recorded here so that it

sounds natural because other words they

ask you what are you well I'm not all

that certain what church do you go to

well I don't go to any church I go I

believe in what it says here I believe

what the Bible says that's not what it

is to be a witness of Yahweh is that

what y'all call this is that way he

formed us and made us an exclusive

nation to say I believe what it says

here I believe what it says here I am an

Israelite whether you like it or not I

believe in Yahweh do you worship God

yeah worse about my God's name is Yahweh

and eternity

I don't worship the Trinity Yahweh is

the only God I have he created me and he

saved me that's it I don't need anything

else you need three a designer a creator

a comforter whatever

you need three different things three

things I only need one alone mine is

everything that I have everything and

it's got to be born from your heart

urine Israelite I'm in this light I'm an

Israelite you're a nurse right not a Jew

why not Jewish maybe some of us are from

tribe Judah but since the name Jewish is

used by that wrong people

we should precisely not use it and aside

from that if you say you're Jewish

they'll immediately identify you with

the Talmud know the rest and if you're

Jewish then you do not accept Jesus the

sake I just another Jew they say so the

no what are you an Israelite also don't

say I'm from lve Elohim didn't charge

you to say lve is my witness that what

he said

it says Israel is my my only witness

there's no other witness of Yahweh there

is no other others are turns hearing

witnesses whatever thing but witness of

Yahweh that Yahweh's one alone that is

Israel that's why we are Israel we are

the servant of Yahweh Israel and that

servant is becoming a wife it is the

servant who got to be the boss and

millionaire in the story of the movies

that servant is the bride at the level

of Yahweh but that has yet to happen so

then we know what is next to happen and

that servant will go through the Great

Tribulation and the one who will be with

him throughout the tribulation will be

Yahweh himself Yahweh himself while the

Christians are raptured unto death

expecting their judgment awaiting their

judgment but never no matter how much

eternal life they achieve never will

there be Israel do you notice never

because they declined be in Israel could

at this time all the Christians say I'm

no longer a Christian I'm now an

Israelite and I worship Yahweh and

understand that y'all was Yahshua I

understand it all cut they are not and

what holds them back for example we

could say we could say that what impedes

them is that yahwah does not give them

that true feeling of saying this but

either way have they not the information

so then if at this time they do not

become the people of Israel they'll

never be Israelite they'll be see what

servants of Israel period they're kings

of everything we'll always be who Israel

period and it's over 12

I'll read again Yahweh affirms I Yahweh

continues to insist that he is the only

one I not we I announced it in

claimed it I have saved you while he

places the salvation of Israel in past

tense he does not say I will save you

don't you worry that I will save you no

no no

Yahweh speaks to Israel his servant as a

fact that he's already saved them and if

he saved them so then he already places

his coming with the name of Yeshua he

already makes it as a consummated fact

I've saved you he tells Israel what do

you mean you saved him yeah I saved you

Israel's already saved everything that I

will do it's her been planned and

executed you know we'll make it come to

pass but the salvation of Israel is

certain the salvation I have saved you

it was that done by a strange god one

that you know not that does not exist

what

so Marvel is a text I have announced it

and proclaimed it says Yahweh I have

saved you it was not done by a strange

God it was not by a member of the

Trinity is not done by the Father the

Son the Holy Spirit it was done by I

Yahweh it was not done by a strange God

then the savior of Israel is Yahweh it

is not the son of Yahweh it is Yahweh

himself for he says it was not done by

another him you know not but you'll know

in the future when he comes I will send

you my son

that is not the truth that is the

parable the truth is that I the only

y'all way I myself save you and you have

no other Savior and you are my witnesses

again he tells you that it's time for us

to stop saying that we don't even know

what we are what are we Israelite

somebody asks you what's your religion

I'm an Israelite and what is it to be an

Israelite I keep all the Old Testament

because if you say turn off they would

not understand and they also understand

that yahwah came to save you who is

Yahweh the one you know as Yeshua or

Jesus

he's also Yahweh but that's what it is

to be a witness a quiet witness is no

good either

so then when they ask you what are we we

are Israelite that's why we keep the

ship hat

the Israelites keep the Shabbat that's

why I keep the feasts because the

Israelites keep the feasts they don't

only keep them out of

application but we love to keep the

feasts and I also forgot to tell you for

example that yesterday when it was

produced in the sky the two blood

witnesses there are 77 exact days till

yom teruah until saccade from yesterday

when the two witnesses of blood were

produced in the sky the Moon and Mars

from that moment on until young Torah

there are 77 days I love that fact 77

days yet another fact of when that sign

was produced in the sky you are my

witnesses I'll read in the Torah samat I

have said it who said it I

but notice how singular I uh yeah wit I

said it and I am he who saved you notice

again he repeats but this chapter I've

told you is absolutely what was the word

I used

I forgot the word aside from marvelous

heart attacking why is it heart

attacking because the Christians will

have a heart attack they gotta have a

heart attack if they would only

understand that is as I said it who said

it Yahweh the Jehovah you have is

Jehovah he says I said it and that was

the one that saved you they're like hold

on Jehovah didn't save me Jesus did

there starts a contradiction that

Jehovah's Witnesses say hold on I I am a

jehovah's witness as they say on which I

was witness then he says I am the one

who saved you

they're like but when he came no he sent

an inferior God to save as they say it

is heart attacking if they would only

see a crystal-clear truth that's here I

said it and I was he who saved you it

was not another it was i Yahweh the one

who created you I saved you

I have made it be known unto you and no

strange God exists among you but all of

Christianity have what strange Elohim ye

are my witnesses says Yahweh and ye know

that I am the only

true elohim how many elohim are there

one one only one and that won't only

read this version because that's what

you should says what does you should say

father i want you to know that you are

the only true eloheem you should have

seen that pray unto the father so then

the father is yahweh evidently and who

is yeshua either he's Yahweh or he's

nobody do you understand that is the

parable New Living Translation in verse

12 it says first I predicted your rescue

then I saved you and proclaimed it unto

the world

no foreign Elohim has ever done this you

Israel are witnesses that I am the only

Elohim says Yahweh only Elohim how many

Elohim are there one do you think that

it's only because of the Shema that we

believe what we believe or is it because

of every prophet every prophet you will

never find a plurality of Elohim except

in creation where he implies that more

Elohim exist but that those Elohim who

exist have nothing to do with us our

only Authority our only Saviour his name

is Yahweh Elohim and he is 113 since

forever

yahwah continues to say just in case

somebody hasn't understood since forever

I am Elohim no one can deliver out of my

hand

no one will undo what I have done he's

saying I'm all trap powerful whatever I

do

no one can counteract and no one can

undo what I do and no one can deliver

out of my hand

no one can no one can be delivered from

my power

I am so powerful that I could destroy

everything absolutely in fact when I do

no one will escape my power taught us a

mat 13 says and I am the same one since

bed a sheet here it is way better

translated than to say since forever

eloheem he says I am the same one since

the beginning since better sheep or

since all eternity they added it since

they're explaining and there is no one

that can remove himself from my hand who

can free himself from my hand I will do

something and who can impede me so then

if Yahweh wants to do something who can

impede him no one if Yahweh once for you

to have a job because you are faithful

unto Him and recognize Yahweh our Elohim

and you decide to lose the best job in

the world

or the only one you could get so as to

not work on Shabbat and the idea

terrifies you to say how am I gonna feed

my children how am i myself gonna eat

what am I gonna pay the rent with

they're gonna kick me out I'm gonna lose

everything end up in jail or whatever

due to not paying if Elohim if you would

only understand that Elohim is the most

powerful being that exists that he does

what he pleases if you were to really

understand that and not just speak it

from your mouth outward as most people

do if you would believe it and

understand it if you would believe it

that's the word if you would believe it

you would not worry if you have to leave

the best job in the world or the only

job in the world because if you trust in

Elohim and you already understand that

your Israelite and you trust an Elohim

Elohim does what he pleases with the

entire world and also with you but you

have to understand it in your mind not

just to say well I'm gonna try I'm gonna

see I'm thinking I don't want to lose

this job right there you're not gonna

receive any blessing because already you

are your setting Elohim in a place of

complete impotence that you are the only

one that can get the job Elohim is not

gonna do anything for you you do believe

in him but you have to deal with it here

however you can right at that moment

tell him we'll stop intervene

with you and what he has he will not

show it because you did not believe who

he is that they you believe who he is

it says no one can free himself from my

power

no one can undo what I do if you're the

son of Elohim and you know that you're

gonna go through trials but in the

trials that says that Allah he himself

is there with you

Yahweh himself what fear do you have you

just have no fear and the last thing you

should do is to be disobedient until

Israel exactly I am that I am that is

what the name of Yahweh means dub the

yard hey Bob hey is I am that I am it is

not actually a name that is so special

that it is the true name of Yahweh

evidently he is I am that I am Yahweh I

am that I am he will give us his true

name later but I am that I am one alone

I am that I am it's not we are that we

are it is what it is we are three we're

two we're gonna try and see what we do I

have a meeting of three right now a

Trinity R would have no no I am I am

that I am one alone

it took his years to understand this but

we had to first understand we weren't

Christian as long as we have the sign of

Christianity and if we have it maybe

here maybe we don't say we're Christian

but maybe someone finds us and would and

I'm Christian just to get by we still

have the sign of Christianity so then

yahwah reveals who he is until is

wrongly because the christians are not

the witnesses of yahweh who are the

witnesses of yahweh israel and we're not

just Israel we now understand that we

must be witnesses of Yahweh every one of

you every one of you is a witness and if

you're not a witness you'll be held

accountable by your boss who's Yahweh

because he'll say I had you to be a

witness and what did you say nothing

nothing

in fact people thought you were

Christian because what's happening is

that you are my witnesses but witnesses

unto the world you're the light of the

world he says if you're the leaven of

the world the light of the world but if

you hide what good is it there he says

it what good is it to put the light

under the table yeah okay I understand

I'm Israel I'm the light of the world

but I'll keep that under the table

Yeshua said what good is that it's no

good it's no good so then at least those

who know you - no but you're Israelite

now they laugh let them laugh that's

their problem it'll be more condemnation

if they laugh now if they get interested

in why you're Israelite there you have a

chance of explaining where you're an

Israelite it's most probable that it

won't get interested but you were a

witness and you were the light at least

of those people 14 but verse are we on

are we on text 14 text 14 very well okay

14 Yahweh the Kadosh elohim of israel

the one who gave you freedom says in

order to save you i shall send people on

to babylon and make all the doors be

opened and the joy of the Chaldeans

she'll turn into pain this is a prophecy

of Yahweh

through Isaiah that says you will be at

some point in time where in Babylon and

I will send certain people who will free

you from there and it says that

precisely the Chaldeans the Babylonian

pride will turn into what pain but that

text gets to us if we're Israelite where

do we live now Babylon is there anymore

Babylon than this we live in nothing but

Babylon but yea what promises us that he

will send people who will free us from

Babylon and the joy of Babylon he says

that it'll become pain that is what you

call it the great brutal tribulation

when we are

liberated from Babylon the book of the

people of God reads this text 43:14 thus

saith Yahweh the Redeemer of you

the Kadosh of Israel for your sake I

have sent people into Babylon to spring

open all the locks in the joy of the

Chaldeans of the Babylonians shall turn

into lamentation that is what I am

expecting very soon to see now the

question is because this was fulfilled

but it will be fulfilled again how many

years was Israel in Babylon 70 and at

the end of the 70 he sent people into

Babylon to destroy Babylon and the joy

of Babylon turned into what into

lamentation said them precisely if this

prophecy was fulfilled exactly to the

letter that is what we are about to

experience but we've got to understand

that Yahweh is not coming to rescue any

Gentile who has he come to rescue Israel

who is in Babylon so then all they who

are in say they are Christian Gentiles

are they gonna be rescued they cannot be

rescued because yeah what comes to

rescue is Rael is Rael and all that

Jubilee of the Babylonians now will turn

into the great brutal tribulation and

we're at the propitious time we know

that we are Israel we know that that

there is only one Elohim we worship only

that Elohim at any time those in charge

will come unto Babylon and their joy

their pride will turn into the great

brutal tribulation lamentation 15 just

in case it's still not clear to Israel

he says I am Yahweh

I am NOT we are I am Yahweh the Creator

of Israel who created Israel Yahweh the

Kadosh elohim and king of you when they

named the issue of the king of the jews

who is the only king yah was the king

and precisely on that sign

what it actually said was Yahweh but how

tremendous is this text yahwah says i am

Yahweh your Elohim the Creator of Israel

the Kadosh Elohim of you not just that

but the king of you so then the only

king is hope Yahweh the only king is

Yahweh 16 exactly the king of Israel

Yahweh the only true king of Israel who

was dying for Israel Yahweh yahwah 16 he

who made a way through the sea that's

when he took his Roe out of Egypt he who

made a way through the sea a path

through the mighty waters yahwah can do

whatever he wants he who brings forth a

powerful army question notice this here

we always well I've already explained

this I'll repeat it again because there

are new people and people that still do

not understand the point I give is

Israel when they were in Egypt and

yahwah sent plagues into egypt what was

most probable was that pharaoh would

have let Israel go on the first plague

but he didn't not cuz he's an idiot but

because y'all would didn't let him it is

clearly written it says Yahweh hardened

the heart of Pharaoh so then all the

sermons of the Christians who say how

hard head it was Pharaoh if only he had

heard eloheem he heard him loud and

clear he heard him loud and clear any

obeyed - what Elohim did Elohim wanted

to punish Egypt and he wanted to destroy

Egypt he wanted to destroy every Elohim

of Egypt and that's why he said

ten plagues and he never let them go

until finally at the tenth plague and

when he let him go on the tenth plague

Yahweh who was not content with the

destruction he had wrought again he

spoke to Pharaoh said go after them go

after them because I will wanted to

destroy the entire army along with

Pharaoh Yahweh did not resign to the ten

plagues he said I'm gonna destroy your

last soldier and even you never think

that the Egyptian was the bad guy yes he

was absolutely a bad guy but not an

idiot

one thing is to be a bad guy and another

to be an idiot do you follow but Yahweh

wanted to punish the bad guy because he

was bad because if the bad guy is very

intelligent he would have saved himself

from the punishment of Yahweh by letting

them go in order for him to receive his

fair judgment and reward yeah what did

not allow him to think because even the

baddest of them all not necessarily

doesn't have to be an idiot he can be

very evil but knows when to stay back to

not receive punishment but Yahweh for

example to a thief that he wants to

punish he will make him steal in front

of the police Yahweh will make him do

that even if he does not want to do it

that is what happens why to punish him

due to sins he committed before it's not

that yahwah is on righteous but yahwah

says the time of your judgment is here

so then he makes bad guys do even the

irrational so as to punish them do you

understand what I say or not southern

pharaoh would have let Israel go but he

didn't let them go because Pharaoh was

in yahwah's grip and anything he sent

him to do let my people go and maybe

Pharaoh would say yeah I want to let him

go but Yahweh would do something in his

mind that would harden him that would

make him so upset I won't let him go but

he had to do that in order for yahwah to

punish him again but not satisfied with

that look at what the text says who

brings forth who brings forth who brings

forth yahwah brought him forth not

Pharaoh pay attention here pay attention

here who brings forth an entire powerful

army

with their chariots and horses to

destroy them the prophet Isaiah says

this extremely clear why did Pharaoh go

out with all his army because he was

evil destroy cuz he was bad now cuz

Yahweh commanded him to accept because

he had to die yes he had to die and

since he was bad and he had to punish

him he says now come no better I want to

you don't want to go sudden like that ya

would take hold of his mind

I will go it's God destroy those are

curse it Israelite who put that in his

mind Yahweh

let's go destroyed them and that people

are like but is this guy crazy no no now

we will destroy him who knows what the

Pharaoh would say this time we walk at

him but where they were headed was to

their own destruction

it says he brings forth an entire

powerful army with their chariots and

horses to destroy them they were thrown

on the floor and weren't able to rise

they are extinguished like a quenched

wick look at the way it says in tourism

at the Spanish tourism it is absolutely

faithful to what is written in the

original he Yahweh he is who brought

forth out of Egypt armed chariots and

horses who brought them forth it was not

Pharaoh

it was Yahweh how did the Christians who

don't understand thing explained this

story that yahwah tried to do everything

to save Egypt he had to punish them

because they were so stubborn and it's

exactly the contrary it says he yahweh

is brought forth out of Egypt armed

Theriault sand horses their squadrons

and all of their brave men lie down in

other words they died as one into the

sleep of death and shall rise not they

have been extinguished as flax and have

perished but how marvelous is this text

it declares t that yahweh the only lame

they are powerful that's why he says no

one can escape from my power not d

understand what he said nor can evil men

breathe himself from his power because

he makes evil men do things that they

don't want to do so they fall into the

trap so then no matter how intelligent

is the evil man no matter how much of a

godfather he is he makes you commit the

error in order to punish you that is

marvelous so then

we see those who are wicked these Jews

the Wiseman of Zion do I worry how wise

the wise men of Zion are no because in

their own wisdom yahwah destroys them

whenever he wants when he considers it

appropriate to destroy them

southern no matter how wise they are

Yahweh who's the wisest of them all and

no one can free themselves from his

power nor anyone can undo what he does

and he does what he wants in the

opportune moment whoever will give you a

job if any of you find it impossible

because you've got to see this if you

know Yahweh you know your father and you

know your husband you'll find out he is

all-powerful when you think that all the

doors have completely shut in your face

how difficult is it for our to open them

he opens whichever he wants he opens the

one you least expect for it open when

you least expect it and you think you're

lost if you trust in Yahweh if he's

making you lose something is so you get

something that's more convenient and to

test you to test you to see if what you

say from your mouth outward is true

let's see if you're really an Israelite

to see what really you have inside if

what you say is what you really believe

cuz Manny from here we're Israelite with

this with that but at the first the

first little problem or big problem they

shoot out to any in all places out to

sin working on Shabbat working on the

feasts I don't care about anything I

haven't asked for the days of their

calculating Ocasek our Christian said

Christian said that this one the first

ones of Shabbat the fifteenth is a

Shabbat the 14th in Pesa Judy Stein said

I could work half a day I'm gonna mark

this half a day what time did you say

twelve okay I have to be what time don't

have to be in your house five o'clock

you said well I'm gonna stretch it to

12:30 12:30 I'll take off at no time and

I'll get there at 5:00 and then it gets

to seven o'clock and all got

sorry I'm late traffic they're not doing

anybody a favor

y'all was watching them if you were to

believe that y'all was your father

they're like no this day is already a so

bad for me since the 14th almost the

13th so I can prepare myself to be

kicked back refreshed saccade I'll take

all the days of saccade no Christian

said that these days were workable this

one too I can work this day boss your

boss your father is Yahweh the day that

you know with home with whom whom you

belong to if you believe it maybe you're

a Christian you know know it you want to

try to be an Israelite but your

Christianity betrays you your

Christianity defeats you and betrays you

sometimes if you believe to be an

Israelite that yah was with you all the

time you would do things in an

absolutely different way from the way

you've done them until now and that's

all the truth from this moment on ever

since I started preaching today don't

ask me because I don't know I preach you

things and I don't know I didn't even

know was gonna have a title called

yahwah a hat and we're already on

chapter 7 I thought that this series

birth you should was abandoned and done

with already absolutely over with I

didn't know there was gonna be a lot

more chapters and I have yet to be done

with it

I never thought that over peach

something about Yahweh had we're in

chapter 7 today you've got to understand

which is the 14th of the 4th month and

the most brutal Blood Moon has already

passed you have to understand your

Israelite and that you're a witness the

only witness of Yahweh Yahweh didn't

give that Church to anyone else no one

else is charged with that those from

Israel are the children of a Zozo

because they reject the issuer

so then what type of illuminated

witnesses are they more like a

eliminated I'd say because they're

children of aces oh the Christians

preach 3 to you what type of witnesses

are they false Trinitarian witnesses

southern yahwah says today i've made you

understand today i've made you

understand that you are my witness

you're my witness not christian you

every one of you is my witness I didn't

give you a prophet as a witness I'll

give you a prophet sir understand

something but now that you understand

you get to understand that every

Israelite that understands this is my

witness that's why the promises for

Israel are so great for you for every

one of you because you're not the

witnesses but the only witnesses that

Yahweh is one that we know Yahweh who

Yahweh really is and that we are the

light of the world that is of what I

didn't have the least idea of where

Yahweh was leading me that is what the

bride of Yeshua Yahweh had is about

Israel you you you you you all of you

every one of you is a witness never

think or say Christine is the witness no

no I'm just as much of a witness as you

are you have directly read it in the

Tanakh that y'all we're speaking to

every one of you you are by witnesses

that I am Elohim and that there is no

other Elohim before me there is not

another an Elohim I have saved you I am

your Savior I'm the only one that will

be with you in the water in the fire in

the midst of tribulation but you've got

to understand it you are my witnesses

and my servant whom I have chosen 18 now

yahwah says unto his people after

everything he told them

yahwah continues to speak to his people

remember not yesterday yesterday when

you didn't understand what he say all

that about there only to remember not

the former things do not remember the

things of old stop thinking about things

of the past but we used to believe

doesn't matter he says today I've

revealed something else to you it's I no

longer remember things of Ault no but no

longer remember things of old but

memorize memorize the message Shama

Israel everything is renewed exactly

Shaima Israel Yahweh Elohim Yahweh hard

now the rest forget it all but my mom

taught me my grandma said there was

three my dad baptized me forget about

that completely forget about that don't

remember the things of old nor consider

the things of old the New Living

Translation says but forget all that

forget about everything you knew before

it is nothing compared to what I'm going

to do so then already now we have

rediscovered the most absolute truth

that the eternal truth has Yahweh had

that is the most absolute truth and

absolute truth so absolutely astonishing

heart attacking a real cannot miss an

eternal life and death matter there is

no greater truth in the eternal truth

than Yahweh HUD

Yahweh hud-1 alone yah was one it could

never change unless they change the

Tanakh they'd have to give us a

completely different turn off with

prophets I've never heard of in order to

change but that can it happen because

it's the only book that exists and

Israel is the only book the only people

that exists yeah we created it designed

it and we're Israelite and he tells us

you are my witnesses that you know me

and believe me that I am only and you're

my witnesses the entire ball is in our

Court

he says I've given you the eternal truth

this is the eternal truth you are Israel

and you're the only witnesses that I am

the only Elohim 19 I am about to do

something new and you'll see that this

very moment it'll appear I shall make a

path in the desert in rivers in the dry

wasteland and I give that as a

fulfillment today because it was

something that was totally new for us

yeah well how does new for us although

it was old it's new and all that about

being witnesses of Yahweh that we're

Israel it is rather the new creation

that Yahweh is make

he says I'm gonna but makes him new he

says a warm-up in a path in the desert

and rivers in the dry wasteland the New

Living Translation reads as follows

isaiah 43:19 reads as follows for i am

about to do something new see i have

already begun do you not see it I will

make a pathway through the wilderness I

will create rivers in the dry wasteland

and I'll tell you the truth

California is a desert it's a desert and

I shall create I shall create rivers

rivers in the dry wasteland and now

Yahweh has created a river of true

knowledge a flow of water of eternal

life so great that for me it is a great

pleasure and privilege communicating to

you that you are Israelite and that you

are valued more than what you used to

believe you were worth that yahwah does

not love you because you believe to be

obedient Yahweh loves you that's why he

created you for his glory why do we

exist for the glory of Yahweh why does

this relax issed for glory of Yahweh

there is no other people that can ever

give glory unto Yahweh so then when we

comprehend who we are and what is our

mission of being a witness and yahwah

made us for his glory we have to start

by comprehending how marvelous this

whole path of the eternal truth has been

20 the wild animals in the fields will

thank me the Jackals and owls to

forgiving them water in the desert

rivers in the dry wasteland

so my chosen people can be refreshed who

are the chosen people Israel so then

from now on who will drink Israel and

what happens with the rest the rest are

fulfilled in the prophecy of Amos where

it says they will go from sea to sea

seeking the word of Yahweh and will not

find it they will try to comprehend and

what what are they gonna receive the

information from the Christians about

the rapture with eternity the baptism

and the name of the Father Son Holy

Spirit absolutely not because the time

is over and they shall go thirsty not

and hungry not of bread and water but of

what of the word of Yahweh it says but

that time will be too too late

isaiah 40:3 23rd osama i like this one

here because here it has a word that i

said wow it is also comparable with the

King James Version it says the beasts of

the field the Dragons hope that's

interesting because they translated the

text as dragons which it could be I

looked it up the beasts of the field the

dragons and the Owls shall honor me look

at what it says in Spanish this will

glorify me why because I give waters in

the wilderness and rivers in the desert

to give drink to my people my chosen

people 21 the people that I have formed

that they proclaim my praise here's the

reason why we're Israel and why we exist

why do we exist but what type of

witnesses are we if we don't proclaim

his praise the only imagined this world

if Israel had not existed just imagine

it this world without Israel for Yahweh

to never have called Abraham from

Babylon that he would have left Abraham

worshiping the idols of his father what

this world thought but who created him

tell me what would they know nothing

what would they know about the whole

history of redemption nothing absolutely

nothing

so then Israel as I told you takes on a

role which is primordial and of

salvation that is why you always says

the salvation comes from home from the

Jews which is Israel precisely their

salvation comes from Israel and it was

the son of Yahweh Israel

God so loved this entire world that he

sent His only begotten Son

Israel is his only begotten firstborn

son that anybody that believed in Israel

who had the truth who are the witness

not perish yet have eternal life because

Israel is the only people that tells you

the truth about Yahweh there is no other

people

there's the Gentiles don't have any

truth there's no lighting the Gentiles

you are the light of the world and of

course is sure when he came was another

Israelite for he is the greatest light

of the world he is the salvation but in

order for him to come unto this earth he

formed a people for himself because he

is Israelite he formed the people unto

himself and he inserted himself into

that people which is precisely the

witness of the glory of Yahweh the

people that I have formed for myself to

proclaim my praise near Living

Translation says I have made Israel for

myself he made his rougher wit and

someday they will honor me before the

whole world apparently they were not

honoring him at that time

evidently not because he destroyed them

the temple scent of the Babylon if we're

in Babylon it is because evidently

Israel was not honoring him but this

prophecy is marvelous I'll read again it

says I Yahweh made Israel for myself not

for a Trinity for myself for myself says

Yahweh in some day that day has been

today and a time ago and some day Israel

shall honor me before the whole world

because the whole world does not have

true understanding they only have false

knowledge absolutely false knowledge 22

but you Israel the people of jacob has

not called upon me now he's speaking to

israel even even that israel that some

day would proclaim and get glory into

our but now israel people of jacob has

not called upon me but that has been

weary of me it is very clear that is why

we're in Babylon

since we were born where were we born

since the day we were born we're in

Babylon because Israel we have not

called them to Yahweh and rather have

grown weary of Yahweh that's why we're

here NLT says but dear lineage of Jacob

you refused to ask me for help

o Israel you have grown tired of me

Israel has grown tired of Yahweh that is

what the truth is you have not brought

me sheep or goats for burnt offerings to

honor me

I have not wearied you asking you for

offerings nor wearied they demanding

instance of thee you have that brought

meat the fragrant calamus to bring it to

me as an offering neither has Duff

filled me with the fat of the sacrifices

on the contrary you have burdened me

with your sins and wearied me with your

faults that's what Israel did do burden

Yahweh with their sins and with their

wickedness the 2001 Jerusalem I like the

way this text this shows up as air 4324

you have not bought me sweet Cain with

money or satisfied me with the fat of

your sacrifices but you sure have

enslaved me with your sins

yahwah says that israel enslaved him

with the sins of Israel there were so

many that yahuwah son slept with the

sense of israel and bored me with your

faults we all was already bored with

israel because israel had already grown

weary and grown tired of yahweh 25 but I

being as I am your Elohim I blot out

your crimes and will not remember thy

sins anymore Wow

Yahweh here says that he does not blot

out the crimes and sins of Israel

because Israel repented and is good but

why for his own sake remember this

yahwah does not blot out your sins

because he sees you love him yahwah has

already plotted out your sins your

crimes because he is our Elohim

that is the secret yahweh blots out your

sins and forgives you with the only

reason that he says I being as I am your

eloheem I blot out your crimes

I don't block them out because you

repent it and you showed me repentance

and then I decided to blot him out it's

not an act of yours it is an act of mine

since I created you and you've rappelled

against me

even so I blot out your crimes

I don't just blot them out I blot them

out from my brain because I will not

remember thy sins anymore the question

is does y'all have memory is his memory

failing is the memory of Yahweh failing

but he promises to forget how does

Yahweh a perfect being that nothing

fails on him can forget all I can

understand from this text is that he can

delete them that's right he himself on

purpose can delete a part of his memory

which are the sins of ours and if he

deletes them as his own deliberate

action does yahwah have the power of

deleting things from himself right

because otherwise we'd say well there's

something he can't do also he'll catch

them the bottom of the sea that is

exactly the same thing it's a deliberate

action of taking out a sin and deleting

it exactly this remember he doesn't

remember it anymore how many of us

desire for yahwah to delete our sins

from his list all of us in the eternal

life every time y'all way looks us in

the eye

but I got a me thinking mighty still

remember that one thing because he

remembers everything mighty remember

that's why he wrote I shall not remember

he wrote that so we know or else we

would say I better be on good terms with

him because he's got such a memory he

says precisely and I will not remember

thy sins anymore

the Spanish LPD version I liked this

25th text it says but I am I alone only

I but I am only I who so then why did

the Christians say that Jesus brought

out the sins the only one that bought

and forgives us Yahweh Jesus nothing to

do with this here if Jesus is a

different being aside from Yahweh's what

I'm referring to if Jesus is another

being aside from Yahweh Jesus has no

power to blot out anything nor forgive

anything

now when Jesus says your sins are

forgiven or Yeshua said actually what

was he actually saying I'm yahwah's

exactly I am Yahweh that's why they say

and who is this get to forgive sins only

eloheem can forgive sins the Israelites

said that who had it clear there was

only one but what he was telling them is

I am Yahweh I'm the only one who has the

right to forgive sins because I am

Yahweh that is what you sure was

precisely saying but that is not

understood by the Christians or do they

they do not understand it they

absolutely do not understand it so then

he says but I am only I who blots out

your crimes out of my known

consideration not out of consideration

to you not because you repented for my

own sake I blot them out because if I

don't block them out I'm gonna go

further than what yahwah says these

aren't y'all ways words they're mine he

says if I don't blot them out I'd have

to kill you all I'd be left people less

and if I form another people they'll do

the same thing so since I seen to the

future how everything will be I'll just

blot him out from my own sake so we can

go on in peace but always believe and

understand that I blotted them out for

mine own sake not for you it means that

we must ask for forgiveness

totally but even so he forgives us why

because if he if he who gave us the law

and we deliberately do not ask to be

forgiven then we do not merit to be

forgiven but we deserve to be forgiven a

lot more than what we ask to be forgiven

a lot more to be forgiven and he's

talking about that people that people

who are father's of whom we were born if

he had not forgiven that entire lineage

he could not take us out now we would

have been destroyed completely and not

even gotten to exist that is why he says

I will blot out your sins I will send

you to Babylon I'll have you a time

there and at the annual honor meet Ferb

buddy he says that's clearly but now

he's talking about the people about half

of the people until once until he

precisely his bright is that understood

now if you understand that you should

not ask to be forgiven or anything then

you include yourself in your father's

who inherited nothing but lies now now

that we understand who yahwah is I asked

to be forgiven and a permanent basis

even because of how stubborn I was

before of not asking to be forgiven

because we should actually ask to be

forgiven and to thank y'all way for what

I notice that if Yahweh blotted out my

crimes I'll ask to be forgiven even for

what I haven't done he's already

forgiven me

do you follow it is absolute

gratefulness and if I were to commit

something even greater being as he's

already forgiven me for everything

before even greater is my desire for him

to forgive me

and to not offend anyone from my lineage

not to offend nor to offend Elohim due

to my sins no sin must not take place in

her lives under any circumstance nor the

consideration of sinning we cannot we're

children of Elohim we're witnesses of

Elohim if we start to sin will end up as

our fathers exactly as our fathers and

if we live in Babylon there's a reason

for the sin of our fathers so then now

that Yahweh reveals done to us there's

so marvelous a truth that we're

Israelite that we're the only ones that

have the light in the world that we're

the only ones that understand that

Yahweh is one that you sure is Yahweh

and everything which we understand the

last thing we can do is to think that we

can sin sin has to be far away we are

witnesses of Yahweh we're not witnesses

of sin we're not witnesses of ASL we are

witnesses of Yahweh that we're sinners

of course we're sinners we're talking

about deliberate sins do you follow

deliver it sins I'll read again the LPD

version says but it is I only I who

blots out your crimes out of my known

consideration and will not remember thy

sins 26 Wow this here is difficult to

understand but for me it's marvelous

Yahweh dares us not the world not the

Christians not the Gentiles

those who have elohim as only one being

but this is difficult to understand but

i will explain it to you to top it off

it is an awful translation but i'll

explain it to you

it says if you have something against me

yeah we're speaking speaking to his

people let's put it to judgment bring

your arguments let's see if you turn out

innocent that is not a good translation

that's not a good translation dr. Samet

bring it to me if not you and to memory

your actions let us both enter into

judgment argue if you have something

that justify you jerusalem 2001 put me

in remembrance and let us argue together

set forth your case that you may be

proved right okay what does this text

mean well this text is very difficult to

understand even in Hebrew it is not

understood there are two ways to

understand it one is yo tells you you

think I'm unrighteous come let's go to

judgments I'm going to show you

everything you've done and then tell me

that I am tell me I'm on righteous and

you're innocent that's one way of

understanding it that's not wrong that's

fine if we enter into judgment go we

would lose surely it's already lost

don't even enter into judgment with

Yahweh because he will beat us in

everything but that's not the way I

understand it I understand it in a

different way it is not that that is

wrong in that interpretation it isn't

wrong because it's difficult to

understand but I understand it in a

different way maybe it'll help you

understand this text I understand that

Yahweh says cuz yeah we just told you

that he blots out your sins for his own

sake and that he'll never remember your

sins so then he says let's go on to

judgment remind me of your sins

and you'll see that there's nothing and

you've already won because I've just

told you that I blot out your judgment

in other words how do I get

to this conclusion it's very simple when

I read the scriptures it's simple

it's as if say there's a case and a

judge tells you all the charges that you

had against you all of them I looked at

him he raced them all because I deleted

them I have power to delete them I

dropped all the charges against you

immediately after he says afterward he

tells you immediately let's go into a

case why would there be a case against

you if the judge told you he's dropped

all charges

how could there still be a case kickback

are you understanding a judge tells you

all the charges against you I dropped

them not because you didn't think but

because I wanted to I just wanted to I'm

your dad let's say let's say that the

judges are dead and our father comes and

says look you have all these charges but

since I'm a judge I deleted them and

they have the right to blot them all out

don't you worry and I didn't blow them

out because of you you're still an

ungrateful son you didn't do anything

for me to blow them out but I did so

because I'm your father and since I'm

your father I'd take on the right upon

myself I'll do what I want and I blotted

them out and I just didn't bottom out

but I blotted them out of everybody's

memory in mind so then he says lug come

into the case why am I going into

judgment to demonstrate my innocence and

when I get to the case they say what

charges are there against him nothing

there's nothing against him Jeff forgive

me they don't exist

it's not that he forgave you they don't

exist he says he brought at them out see

one thing is to be forgiven the charge

of theft but it's as forgiving it's

heard forgive no it doesn't say that he

says it brought it out there isn't there

isn't if they delete your record if you

had a ticket let's say you were driving

and you ran a red light in a stop sign

like Armando the same stop sign three

four times same stop sign right he gets

to the the same stop sign they always

stop him at and let's say that our mundo

gets four tickets for that but he has a

friend as I used to know who works at

the DMV a great friend did you know that

if you had somebody that works at DMV if

they want they could delete the charge

they can delete it doesn't

exist anymore and they look at the

police report and doesn't match with

anything and that's it it's over so then

I'm telling you cuz it's a real story

they'll delete according to how much

money you have or if you're a friend of

somebody that works at DMV if your

friend was the boss there and he says

not delete everything I'll delete

everything than work or else how do you

think that Hillary Clinton is still free

cuz they delete everything or else where

would she be

long ago she would be behind bars Trump

could never send it behind bars because

Trump says that he wanted to imprison

her but the churches dropped what

happened with the charges they're no

longer there and if bitter and exist

what could they do

she wasn't forgiving it's not that she

was forgiven for having killed children

no no no it doesn't say kill children

forgiving the charge is not there it

doesn't exist and if it doesn't exist

there's no condemnation

so then yahwah says first of all it

tells you precisely i'm your elohim i

blot out blot blot out your crimes and

it will not remember your sins anymore

but if you have something against me

let's go into the judgement bring your

arguments let's see if you turn out

innocent how are we gonna turn out

they're innocent because there are no

churches

he says you have churches I did this is

yo it I don't find it but I used to work

in Shabbat and I went to the feasts and

because I didn't want to get together

with my lineage I went to work I am a

sinner

yahwah says let's see if that's true

no that day i don't have anything

against you on that day let's go and

tell counties i don't have anything so

then no i don't have anything so java

that's it I'm not gonna condemn you

there is no fault

because if the DMV deletes your tickets

what what does anything I'm to do

nothing it's deleted something that's

the way that I understand this text have

you ever understood it like that

ok so then when you read it like that

that is the only way that's why it says

remind them unto me the Jerusalem says

remind them unto me and let's set forth

your case what do we have to remember my

crimes Lord I am a sinner did this and

that yo says let's he remind him unto me

let us argue together set forth your

case that you may be proved right you

have already won the case cuz y'all with

bladder up your crimes your Israel bar

know the currents of Evelyn oh those

were 30 you're gonna judge them for that

cuz I am forming judge those Witnesses

on and forth us judges so you'll take

care of those and you'll see whether you

forgive them or not it won't be I but

you maybe you want to forgive so many

things and when I resurrect them you

will tell them I forgave all these

things to you to the people we forgave

all kinds of things to you you did not

deserve it

but we think you'll make good citizens

in the new earth so then don't do this

anymore and not this anymore remember I

used to don't do this anymore either not

this either

and with new good nature the people say

oh thank you for since they never

repented for you forgive them for them

are you following that is absolutely

marvelous Elohim does that for Israel

he says you never even repented I

forgave you how tremendous is that for

my own sake not because you're good or

because you deserved it from mine own

sake but then he leaves in hence of

Israel the entire humanity well that is

absolutely marvelous that's why people

will worship the 144,000 because there

are there judges in there the bride of

Yahweh because there are the bride of

Yahweh what could be less than the

bright of Yahweh do you see absolutely

it's impressive

very well 27 your first father sent Oh

obviously what ancestor of ours did not

sin and it's not the monkey that we're

talking about because maybe some still

have the doctrine if Babylon right there

like a sinful monkey no there's not a

sinful monkey your first ancestor

starting with Adam your first ancestor

sent your own teachers rebeled against

me so then in other words of the Kahane

he's talking about the Kahane the Kahane

and the kings and leaders of Israel send

against me says Yahweh the tortoise matt

says your father sent first we can

understand that your father as Abraham

we can understand it as Jacob as well

because all of those are your father's

your father's in first

and your intercessors transgressed

against me those are the Kahane the

priests for those of you that don't

understand the word Kehinde intercessors

or mediators 28 your governor's profaned

my temple that's why I allowed for

Israel the people of Jacob to be

destroyed and insulted the here's the

reason why were in Babylon there's no

other reason otherwise we would have

been born in Israel the New Living

Translation says as f43 20 verse 28 and

it's the last text I just noticed

there's no way of explaining John 16

even though I did what was impossible

you see that this text is heart

attacking Lee spectacular as their 43 is

well it is rather fantastic that is why

I have disgraced your priest he says

Kahane we could say priests they're in

Spanish priests sounds like a huge hog

that is why I have disgraced your

priests

I have decreed complete destruction for

Jacob and shame for Israel that is the

reason it continues we'll continue read

chapter 44 because it's the same message

but there yahwah tells us why we're in

Babylon why are we in Babylon because

our first father sent the priests sent

the king sent the judges sent they all

sent he destroyed the temple and

punished Israel but it is promised that

even with all of that he says that he

blots out the crimes and when we

comprehend this he says don't you worry

enter into judgment with me let's see

what charges are there against you we

won't find any because I'm your Savior

because I am Yahweh who blots out your

sins and I make them disappear I am your

only Savior there is no other Savior

outside of me

Yahweh step out may the Lord bless you

and keep you

lelou yeah - every one of you we shall

wrap this up with a word unto her father

Yahweh about beloved yahwah that art in

heaven thank you for leaving us this

message which is actually the eternal

truth that your one alone yahwah is

about our only Savior creator and

Redeemer of Israel that we who accept

that you are Elohim the only true law

team that there is no one who was formed

before you nor ever be formed after you

we are Israel because we understand and

we hear your words Lord bless your

people

we are dispersed in Babylon we're in the

north and we're in the south and you

promise that you will call and gather

your sons and daughters and we know that

you will no longer gather them for now

in that Israel who is occupying the

place where you chose for your people to

live know that Jerusalem which is ruled

by Zionists and people that don't want

to know anything about you but in your

home in heaven for a thousand years Lord

come soon together us we are already

waiting for you we have understood your

words and your promises you are our only

Elohim Yahweh said out and unto you we

pray in the name with which you came to

this earth thank you Lord for

forgiveness all of our crimes and sins

thank you Lord because you don't only

blot them out but you also promise to

delete them from your mind and if we

were to enter into judgment with you we

would turn out completely innocent for

you have blotted out all of our crimes

and sins blessed art thou forever

Yahweh's about all this we ask for in

your precious name

Yeshua HaMashiach Alleluia to everyone
