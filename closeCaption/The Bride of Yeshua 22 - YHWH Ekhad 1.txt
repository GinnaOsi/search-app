shabbat shalom to each and every one of

you my friends on this so precious day

of Shabbat which is sunny and hot as

well as precious which corresponds to

the 24th of Zev which is on its way out

of the year five thousand nine hundred

eighty seven in yahwah's calendar and

the Gregorian calendar this corresponds

to the ninth of June of the year 2018 we

shall study yet another chapter of the

bride of Yeshua this is part 22 which

bears a title which I want to leave

engraved in every one of your hearts

lineage of the eternal truth Yahweh

Akkad I want for that Yahweh a HOD from

this point on for it to be engraved in

our hearts and in our minds in a way as

never before today is a day very special

because we shall change certain concepts

which maybe some of you had as truths as

something a bit ambiguous and today I

shall define some concepts that have to

be clear in every one of us

we are 15 days away from chef what 71

and forever well chef walked 70 and

there's only a few days left we live

this year in a very special way a year

in which this Earth's life was marked

forever we shall see that when we

comprehend everything at its due time

once we get to our DC the end we shall

understand what yahwah did on this year

number 70 on this shovel at number 70

today is cheb at number 53

it was a long year it had 13 months and

there are only 15 days left of this chef

what number 70 we're on the Omer

countdown today is week 5 day 35 last

day of the week when the Sun leaves well

and turn to week 6 day 36 very well very

well

just as you are let us address Yahweh

beloved Yeshua will give you thanks Lord

for you give us life and you give us the

opportunity of understanding your

mysteries the most hidden ones to human

understanding I ask you that we may

comprehend today this so fundamental a

truth which is the Shema and that

everything which is applied and what is

written afterward that we should all

measure it with this rod which is the

Shema I ask all this in the precious

name of the king in husband of Israel

Yahweh about the Lord has blessed with

another year of life the following the

following persons friends of the lve

lineage there's always that word and

back of our minds which we don't want to

pronounce but which we have pronounced

for many years the word brother in

Spanish which means snake we don't want

to be that at all and here are the

following members of the lve lineage

loose maha let Pina Venezuela Laura

Rivera the US of A

Jason Pinto Colombia Molina Hernandez

Cortez Colombia Luis Enrique Cal Watchi

Colombia

Abigail Ramirez Rios Argentine angel

kadmiel Esparza Mexico Jose Espinal the

Dominican Republic for each and every

one of you my most esteemed group of the

lvl lineage which is especially having a

birthday or had a birthday this week

many blessings from our elohim upon

every one of you we are living the last

days of the second month of Ziv which is

on sway out this is date 24 so then we

have only 5 days left for this month us

only 29 days and the moon will come out

visibly on the 14th day of June in other

words this Thursday June 14 throughout

the course of all of Thursday and when

you're all working on Thursday once the

Sun is leaving on Thursday and it's

about to become Friday and the Sun

leaves then the moon will be seen giving

the initiation to the month the month

begins being as the Sun has left at that

moment the month begins on the 15th of

June Friday June 15th the first of Sivan

so then everyone off to look for the

moon and to take pictures and share no

matter if you don't see it from your

house but someone else from the lineage

will see it so then take pictures

take pictures and it is important for

we're on the 29th day it is important

and the moon will actually be visible so

don't you worry because the moon will be

very visible don't see no matter if I

myself don't see it or if I'm in El

Salvador and couldn't see it that didn't

matter

my eyes are just as worth as yours or

anyone's who can say I saw it at this

hour

actually it's important hat wouldn't see

it the witnesses exactly the witnesses

very well and of course we already get

close to shove whoa this is a shovel

whoa that's very special because if the

Lord has been revealing unto us during

this whole shall vote number 70

revealing consequential things in

importance in a magnificent way and the

lord yahwah has made us an invitation to

being his wife that was precisely last

Shabbat first he gave us his intentions

he showed us his intentions and then

last rabat formally we were able to

understand the invitation of Yahweh and

it was during a date that was very

special

217 an absolutely special date the

disasters in the world do not stop but

rather become augmented actually we have

seen things that we had never seen

before and an event is being added to

another and another and another proverbs

25:2 it is the glory of Elohim to

conceal the word how is the word

concealed concealed we've got to

understand that because sometimes we

want to understand what is written

but Yeshua said the letter is worth

nothing

so then we want to understand in a

certain way because it's written that

way and it's gotta be that way

but the word is concealed and if the

word is concealed

then the word has to be understood to a

deep level not superficially but a deep

level it's all a parable

it is absolutely needed to have the

correct interpretation to actually

comprehend what Yahweh is saying if only

yah we were clear when he speaks then

every time he would give a subject or

said something it was still clear there

wouldn't be any controversies none the

entire world would have the same point

of view because the letterer is clear

but yahwah tells us that the letter is

concealed and that is where all the

problems begin absolutely all the

problems because one reads one thing and

says this has this another guy comes

along greets the same thing and says no

this is this other thing and the other

guy comes along in suspense it doesn't

say what I wanted to say then I'll

change it so then they add and then they

say but it won't be understood in that

language yet it translate it to other

languages so then the translator comes

along and he understands what he

understands and translates what he

understands not what it says but what he

understands and if two that we had all

the idioms of every language forget

about it so then what gets to us is

something that has been added distorted

and is translated it is manipulated so

then if you think that it was difficult

in the original already in the original

the word was concealed if that which is

concealed is added on to translate it

taken from house the word left even more

buried so then we've got to go back to

the base and today we'll go back to the

base the base because it is a

commandment and because really we cannot

comprehend anything if we don't

understand this principle we've already

understood that the true worship of

Yahweh yahwah considers it a sexual act

with him whatever other worship to any

other eloheem yahwah says you're

fornicating you're having sex with

another God you have

not seen that or you had not understood

before but every time we Devi ate our

attention in worshiping whatever that is

not what we have to worship yahwah says

you are having sex with that other

entity it is absolutely clear and so

then we've got to go back

that was absolutely left clear at the

beginning it was a little difficult for

you to understand but on the second

subject that presentation was so clear

textually that there you comprehend it

that what I had said was so and whatever

deviation yahwah says you are having sex

with others you broad he calls

Israel he tells them instead of

receiving your husband you receive

strangers what happens is that Yahweh

sees worship as a sexual act in itself

now having understood that we have to go

back to the beginning because we could

be caressing the wrong idea and by

caressing the wrong idea that would lead

us for us to fornicate with others

there's something that we've got to have

very very clear what we have to have

very clear is that Yahweh if had the

word Ahad is one if you hear the

Trinitarians they say no he's not one he

is one unit and do you know why they say

that he is one unit not one but one unit

well actually what happens is that you

have the text you have the text of

better sheep when Adam says then man

shall leave his father and mother and

shall cleave unto his wife and they will

be one that word is a HUD so then the

turnit Aryans say if the word one which

Adam uses which is a HUD

it's talking about a one man and one

woman that get married in our one you

see it's two people there so it's not

talking about one but rather of one unit

matrimony is one unit I am giving you

the basic principle of the turn Turing's

here but they do a but they know not the

Scriptures for when yahwah says that

there one is that one unit mind you they

are one how many was Adam before Eve was

formed from Adam how many were there

just the one when he took her out of

Adam and they were United how many other

one that's not one unit it's one just

like that one the number of a unit and

to say that a unit is a HOD that's where

we're wrong when yahwah says that Israel

was one the entire people were one it

wasn't referring to and they were one

unit no no it was referring to one it is

the number one one so then in that

aspect the trans Aryans could be right

in that three could be one are you

following

if it were in a way written that I'm

about to show you

so then with that principle it could be

that if if two million people re had if

two separate people are I had then could

three be anahat of course cotillion had

years of course for five or two million

one Ahad so then we've got to see in

what context is the word a had that is

what we have to understand today clearly

one is one not a unit one one saw them

let us repeat this text till we're blue

in the face because you don't know it by

memory and today today the 24th of Zev

of the Year five thousand one hundred

eighty seven is the day you have to

repeat it every day of your life every

day of your life gotta repeat it because

is the only safeguard that you have to

not deviate if you had repeated this

text from that time this Minister begin

every day you would not have any doubt

in what I speak but the doubts are

formed because we don't have this text

clearly this text reads as follows

Shaima Israel Yahweh Elohim Yahweh a had

repeat after me

Shaima Israel Yahweh Elohim Yahweh had

okay that you've got to repeat and

repeat it in three three steps repeated

Shema Israel Yahweh Elohim Yahweh had

this means here o Israel

Shama means to listen here o Israel

Yahweh Elohim knew means lor means one

God Elohim means the plurality the blue

blue reality of what God has which is a

God that's super with all the attributes

you could ever think of that is what

Elohim is Loa is only one God one God

just a regular regular old God Elohim is

an adorable God per se and also an

authority and authority now you already

know Yahweh it

that is a Lehane what is eloheynu melech

I know is the contraction of two words

in Hebrew that means our Elohim our

Elohim it's as if to say by bali-ba is

Lord our husband and balli my lord

or my husband do you understand very

well then because just as in English you

see how an English also there are

who are put together like did not

you've got didn't contractions many of

them that's just one example we are two

we're exactly southern what ello hey new

means is our Elohim when we say L oh hey

new it's our Elohim if we say Elohim

there ways to think before that it was a

link directly there

it was Yahweh Elohim but whose do you

follow L oh hey new means our Elohim so

then the word L oh hey new is the

contraction of towards which means our

Elohim so then it says listen o Israel

Yahweh our Elohim Yahweh a HOD Yahweh

one now if here would if I were to say

here and pay attention please because

this goes against all the line

Trinitarians here it says hear o Israel

Yahweh our Elohim Yahweh is one the turn

trillion say here the three those who

believe in to say here are the two and

both are wrong wrong here there is only

one because when it says 1 it says the

word the name of that eloheem if it had

said elohim a had you might say well

elohim which could mean gods are 1

the gods are 1 do you follow but it

doesn't say elohim a had it says Yahweh

a had which is different so then in the

context of a hard which is 1 it says

Yahweh is 1 it's over

Yahweh is 1 this could never say listen

o Israel Yahweh our Elohim Yahweh are 3

a HUD pastors like Gambetta

say that there are 3 hours yah with the

father yo the Sun and you're the Holy

Spirit that's how they fixed the text

they're like three Yahweh's it says

right there that is precisely to violate

the entire Torah because yahwah is one

I'm about to demonstrate it but I'd like

to record this in you because if you do

not understand this concept today and

you record it you can understand what

I'm about to explain you will try to

reject what I'm about to say very well

then so then what do the Jews both old

and modern have you've seen how they tie

something to their foreheads something

black what do they have tied their thank

me it means I had been told when I was

young my mom told me they have tied the

Ten Commandments there then they told me

they have the entire Torah tied there

that's what I've been told then I

believed everything

neither the two they have tied there you

know what they have tied there they have

- Emma - Emma is what they tied there

and you know why you know why let us

read on let us read this time let us go

to devaron six for Deuteronomy 6:4 every

day of your lives from now on until her

husband appears or you disappear from

the living one of the two one of the two

that's one of the possibilities mind you

either you sure appear so we disappear

someday so then from now on every day of

your lives you have the obligation the

obligation of repeating this Gemma

Israel Yahweh oh hey no Yahweh had but

it has to come out in a way that's

natural not forced not because you're

reading it chemise right I was in it

yeah well he knew what was the next part

no no it has to be fluid listen to

Israel Yahweh our Elohim Yahweh's one

but just like that fluid without reading

anything fluidly and the exercise you've

got to practice from now on for the rest

of your lives

repeat it in both languages first in

Hebrew

Shema Israel yeah willow hey new Yahweh

HUD it is very easy if you repeat it in

three steps Shama Israel

yeah well oh hey no Yahweh HUD and then

in English here o Israel Yahweh our

Elohim Yahweh is one that is absolutely

necessary in order to record it in your

hearts but let's see what is written

let's go to depth and repeat it wherever

you are

they have arranged six for Deuteronomy

6:4 Deuteronomy in English six for or

dividing six for in Hebrew it reads as

follows

I'll read assist hear o Israel Yahweh

our Elohim Yahweh is one that's the way

it's written in the Spanish RV 1960

verse five it directly continues and

thou shalt love Yahweh Dyne eloheem thou

shalt love this being who is one and

thou shalt love Yahweh thine eloheem

with all thine heart and with all thy

soul and with all thy might everything

which you are soul mind body everything

your sexual energy your strength your

money what you own with all that you

must love Elohim what Elohim the yahwah

eloheem who's one who's one i'll read on

it says verse six and these words which

I command thee this day wow this is

fundamental and these words which I

commend beat this day and I'm also

commending you which actually is Yahweh

he's commanding all of us but apparently

we didn't read all this all that much

and these words which I command thee

this day and I'm going slow because

today it's not much information but

rather I want to record this in your

minds shall be in thine heart where do

they

to be never will yahwah give us a new

covenant if we don't have this record in

our hearts and in the new covenant it

says that would to say that he's gonna

record that new covenants in our heart

but first we better record this covenant

in our heart and these words which I

command thee this day shall be in thine

heart but hold on a minute

what words the entire Torah no no no no

again I'll read the words here o Israel

Yahweh our Elohim Yahweh is one and thou

shalt love Yahweh Dinah Lehane with all

thine heart and with all thy soul and

with all thy might and these words which

I command thee this day shall be in

thine heart and thou shalt repeat them

what must be done with those words and

thou shalt repeat them unto your

children and shalt talk of them when

thou sittest in thine house and when

thou walkest by the way and when thou

liest down and when thou risest up so

then what must be repeat before we go to

bed or the entire Torah you see how it's

not talking about the trial here not

even talking about the 10 commandments

no no no it's talking about exactly

these two things I said the VESA mah and

that we must love Yahweh with all our

heart our mind and strength

I'll read again and these words which I

command thee this day shall be in thine

heart and thou shalt repeat them unto

your children and shalt talk of them

when thou sittest in thine house when

one can we talk about it once a year

every day someone died walkest by the

way when you walk into work or two

whatever it says you must have these

words in your heart when thou liest down

just in case if you didn't understand is

when you lie down remember those words

and say them and when that rises up and

then when later on you rise up but say

the Shema and i shalt bind them just in

case you forget thou shalt bind them for

a sign in thine hand so then the signs

we tied to our hands a sign of what is

it Elisha and thou shalt bind them for a

sign upon thine hand and they shall be

as frontlets between thine eyes

that's why we see the Jews with those

little boxes the tefillin that's why

those two filling which is that tight

box it's not that they're ridiculous

although they are but they're not

because that part about that shalt bind

them for a sign in thine hand and they

shall be as frontlets between thine eyes

it's not really saying that they should

tie them really hear what it's saying is

that you bind it in between your two

eyes and to bind something between your

two eyes it has to be in your brain do

you follow how do i bind something

between my two eyes it's gonna be in my

brain because if that is not as a seal

in my brain Shema Israel

yeah will oh hey no Yahweh had if that's

not there at some point in time I shall

deviate nobody for a second that Elohim

exaggerated because everyone deviated

from this that's the problem the entire

world deviated from this and even we

could deviate from this as well so then

it says that you should say them repeat

them but it doesn't end there it doesn't

end there they shall be as frontlets

between van nuys in thy brain written

and fire there and thou shalt write them

upon the posts of thy house

what does yeah we want us to do with

that tell the truth that I haven't done

so yet but I will

what I need to do I need and all of you

to put up a little sign in your house

even if it's small it's not that you're

gonna tear down a wall of your house or

put up a graffiti no no no don't do any

graffiti put up a nice little sign that

says my Israel

yeah will oh hey new yeah we had that's

all you have to put up if you don't want

that then put up a virgin or a saint

it's the same thing if you don't have

that same thing if you don't have that

then you believe something else that's

what I'm getting it welcome home exactly

welcome to hell whatever other thing

whatever other thing you put up is a

violation to what y'all was saying

Yahweh says put up the shim ah put it in

your mind put it in your heart when you

get a bed when you rise up say two

children repeat

have them repeated did you know the

problem of Israel in the whole world's

problem is that they forgot about this

this is a commandment of the base of the

base and it says and thou shalt write

them upon the post of the house and in

thy gates do you know why yahwah says

that because he knew that the people was

gonna forget about it so then if it sat

in your doorpost you go by and already

psychologically you see it

psychologically it's kind of like all

the signs you see on the freeway you

drive past them and you don't look at

anything well your brain side of other

sudden you have a crazy urge of drinking

coca-cola you don't even know why

someone's asking bacon too to it to

themselves

no they're asking if they can tattoo it

to themselves it doesn't say here for

you to tattoo it if they were to say

that I would not have the slightest

doubt it would be against the other

commandment it would be against the

other one see we could get to the other

extreme so then don't what it says yes

Ted to them but in your doorpost yeah a

nice little tat and the doorpost not on

you on the doorposts just bind them to

you not to to them bind them bind him to

your hands not tattoo to your hand bind

to your hand I heard a story I don't

know whether it's true about an

Argentinian young man in the 1982

Falklands War which we know as the

Malvinas war there are many Jews in

Argentina you know this the Jews over

abound an invasion of Jews so then when

the military officers got all these

little soldiers and recruited them

without much knowledge in warfare and

let's go to the South one of them was

Jewish so then this young man became

desperate it was like I've always been a

Jew but never learned anything of the

Torah and it came to pass that he saw

somebody that was praying there in

Hebrew and he went and told them teach

me to pray I'm also Jewish and I don't

know a thing

typical typical I'm a June don't know a

thing teach me at least one prayer he

asked him sir than the other guy the

other young men told ok learned this at

least

Israel Yahweh Elohim Yahweh had says

that he loved that so much and he told

them you've got to say that always every

day

whatever you do repeat that so then he

kept repeating by memory he loved it it

says that it brought him lots of peace

because he wanted to pray so they were

at war in the Malvinas and as you

already know well I don't know how much

you know but at least the Argentinians

took over the Malvina Islands or the

Falklands as the Brits know it which of

course they're a part of our gen Tina

they're part of the Argentine territory

England has nothing to do there nor the

US nor anybody not at all whatsoever

they haven't the slightest right over it

but of course they need that strategic

point they need it so then Argentina

took over him now I'm not gonna discuss

here whether that was arranged or not I

could care less but the poor soldiers

who always don't know a thing a weapon

was put in their hands and were sent off

to fight when the US helped England and

they started to know what I mean

they start to invade the isle to retake

it

that's where almost all the Argentinian

soldiers that died died they were killed

by the English they had better weapons

they had thermic suits they're

Argentinians were freezing to death

the weapons wouldn't shoot because of

the cold is a disaster anyway all of a

sudden he was in the trenches and he

says that he raised his eyes and the

British soldier was pointing at him with

an automatic weapon and this was in the

heat of war so then it says that he

froze where he was because he knew he

was gonna die and exclaimed Shaima

Israel Yahweh Lohan knew Yahweh had and

he closed his eyes but the bullet didn't

come he opened them again and the

British soldier said he continued what

was next but in Hebrew he lowered his

weapon and he told them and run away he

left running and the British soldier

killed the rest of his crew he was the

only one that was safe from that group

the only one I was able to tell the

story that because of that prayer as it

turns out the Englishman was also Jude

get Jews all over the place it was

another Jew and when you heard that he

said nah I can't kill you go ahead and

eat run away from here and the rest of

his crew they all died because they were

riddled to death they're just a story

whether it's sure not I could care less

that matter that matter I told you a

star just tell you story cuz I know it

what importance does that have for us

it's life and death

so life and death as the soldier to

understand that or not is life and death

as clears that so then once we have this

as our base it is the level that we're

gonna measure everything else that's

ever been written if something

contradicts this what's more important

what's written afterwards or this base

this base this base this foundation it

is unbreakable unbreakable and the rule

to measure anything whatever insinuation

declaration written by whomever no

matter what prophet writes it or apostle

angel or by whomever who contradicts

this then we know that we're either not

understanding what he's saying or that

directly he's false or it was mace

translated or that that part has been

added because the Shema is unbreakable

are you following this because if this

is not understood if we had complied

with this commandment already from a

while back you see what happens is that

that starts to grow in our heart one

thing is to hear to all how nice and

another is to repeat it every day the

whole time Shama Israel Yahweh Elohim

ooh Yahweh had but that when we

accentuated in our minds what begins is

the change in our nature I've seen

everything else

right now you may not probably see what

I'm saying because you accept what is

written but it is not yet deep-rooted in

your heart it's the program say what

program right so what I'm saying is that

it is not engraved and for yourselves to

already start to develop based on this

truth are you following because this is

the fundamental truth of everything else

we'll see a fundamental truth and that

fundamental truth one thing is to accept

it and another is for it to are to be a

part of your nature when you show says I

will give you a new matrimonial contract

a new covenant and I will give it in

your heart he assures that that it'll be

accentuated and be a part of our nature

well then this it is our job to take it

into our nature this is not yahwah's

work it is our work Yahweh tells us how

to repeat it every day to repeat it

before going to bed to repeat it when we

wake up to tie our hands to write it to

our doorposts to teach it to our

children

and that are not permanent bases when we

go out of our house to have that on our

mind when we start to do that it already

starts to be part of our nature

are you following one thing is to learn

to play whatever sport do you see how a

ball is hit look at how this player hits

it look at Federer look at Nadal hitter

like them can they hit it that way

no no matter if they look at him they

say okay I'm gonna hit that way let's

see hit it right like Pele kicks it or

rather the way Pillai used to like the

way Pele used to kick it you see how

easily play kicks it do it that way no

matter how you accept it the way he does

it it doesn't turn out that way why

doesn't it because you need lots of

practice aside from the fact that it has

to be a part of your nature this what

I'm teaching today we can you see you

cannot take plays Nature Federer's an

owl's nature you can't but what you can

do is take this nature because this is

repetition this doesn't go from it's not

like it's something that you're already

born with it and that it's easy no this

is repetition repetition repetition

repetition until until the mind the

heart and the stress

they'll start to understand and it forms

a part of our being very well then

now let's go to Isaiah 45 8 to 25 I'm

gonna continue with this line of true

thought Isaiah 45 8 through 25 drop down

ye heavens from above and let the skies

pour down righteousness let the earth

open and let them bring forth salvation

and righteousness let them spring up

together o Yahweh have created it who

says that created all this I Yahweh it

doesn't say we Yahweh but rather what I

Yahweh woe unto him that striveth with

his maker woe unto him that striveth

with his maker the pot shirt with the

pot shirts of the earth shall the clay

say to him that fashioned at the what

make us now or thy work he had the no

hands woe unto him that saith unto his

father what beget us now or to the woman

what has now brought forth thus saith

Yahweh the Kadesh of Israel and his

maker ask me of things to come

concerning my sons and concerning the

work of my hands command ye me I have

made the earth does I mean we made the

earth or is it I'm a deer okay when we

understand that the Shema is one that

yah was one not three not one not two

but one we understand that there's only

one person that is the Creator

and here he says I I away made the earth

and created men upon it I there's a

reason why he repeats I a lot I even my

hands listen well I even my hands have

stretched out the heavens and all their

hosts have I commanded I have raised

them up in righteousness and I will

direct all his ways he shall build my

city and he shall let go my captives not

for price nor reward saith Yahweh of

hosts verse 14 thus saith Yahweh the

labor of Egypt and merchandise of

Ethiopia and of the sabaeans men of

stature shall come over unto thee and

they shall be thine they shall come

after thee in change they shall come

over and they shall fall down and to the

they shall make supplication son to the

saying surely in thee is Elohim and

there is none else outside of a lame

how many others Arthur can there be

another verse 15 starts to take count

because it doesn't say there is no other

that's the word how many limbs other one

there's another 15 verily thou art

Elohim that hidest I self that conceals

himself elohim of israel the savior who

is the savior yeah with the elohim of

israel i read this as their 45:15 and

there's tourism at I like the way they

wrote it Isaiah 45 15 verily thou art

and hidden Elohim or invisible elohim of

israel our Savior who is israel savior

who is it

Yahweh Yahweh Yahweh well who died

Yahweh who died Yahweh bear Wheldon

memorized this because it is very

why do you think that when a Christian

comes along some dumb Christian unto the

Jews they kick him out of there because

Christians believe in the Trinity and

they come with three they come at you

with three a Jew who repeats the Shema

every day how much success kid an

ignorant Christian have none because as

soon as the Christian up in his mouth

the other one says shame Israel Yahweh

Elohim Yahweh had yeah please look over

here because you don't know it yet go

ahead and read and review this you have

to memorize it so then whatever foolish

Christian comes along and says I want to

teach you because Elohim because Jesus

or Yeshua the son of God son of God

Shaima Israel Yahweh LaHaye No Yahweh

had did that sound like God has a son

yeah he's very coming up meet with the

son of God that would already make -

that would be in direct violation of the

Shema this is 1.21 not just the Shema

everything that i'm reading here moving

on 16 ashamed and confounded shall all

of them be they shall go to confusion

together that are makers of images in

makers of images are the Catholics all

the Christians because what image do

they fabricate the Eternity I never went

to a seventh-day Adventist Shabbat

service that didn't begin with the

invocation

what is the invocation they invoke the

Father the Son and the Holy Spirit but

that's something that no one initiates

one service no one begins a service

without an invocation to the Father the

Son and Holy Spirit so then those are

the images they're all images Israel 17

Israel shall be saved in Yahweh where's

Israel saved who is the only one that

could save Israel not the son of Yahweh

because if it's the son of

yeah with and this is all wrong it's all

wrong

Israel shall be saved in Yahweh with an

everlasting salvation when a Christian

comes along and he talks to a Jew and he

tells them Jesus is the savior so guys

like say what the entire Tanakh says

that yah was the savior who is that

Jesus are you following doesn't feel it

does not enter I'll read it again

because we've got to understand this

Israel must be saved in Yahweh with

everlasting salvation he shall not be

ashamed nor come founded

world-without-end so then those who

believe in Yahweh shall never be ashamed

nor ever be confounded ever listen to

what it's saying verse 18 for thus saith

Yahweh that created the heavens

Yahweh the Creator Yahweh is the creator

for thus saith Yahweh who created the

heavens he is Elohim that formed the

earth who made it and hath established

it he created it not in vain he formed

it to be inhabited for I am Yahweh and

there is none else it is written in all

the versions what's it say it doesn't

say we are Yahweh and there's none

outside of us it's as I one sole person

and it is so clear in Hebrew I am Yahweh

and there is none else wait a minute if

there's none else how do they come and

tell us that Jesus came the son of

Yahweh he says I am Yahweh and there is

none else none else is none else if

another comes along then he's false

are you following if another comes along

as false I'll tell you from the get-go

but no one can identify him as false if

the Shema has not had in the mind if one

has this golden rule in the mind in the

nature you say they're like I want to

present you someone else you like keep

him there is none else I

one and they have one when do the

Adventists the Christians the Messianic

when did they accept another when they

don't have the Shema understood and

engraved in their nature are you

following what I'm saying

okay very well because you're gonna find

heavy what I'll teach later that's why

I'm telling you I have to set this as a

base as an eternal base moving on I'll

go ahead and read this text in the

tourism at isaiah 45:18 taurus amat for

this is what yahweh says creator of the

heavens the same elohim who formed and

conserves the earth he didn't just form

it what else does it serve Z he guards

it care of it takes care of her Himself

that formed it and that not in vain that

he created but rather he made it that it

be inhabited i Yahweh and there is none

other than me that's it it's over the

message into his rules is very clear I

am Yahweh the Creator and you have none

other than me the only one not that I'm

gonna send my son no no no who's gonna

send his son they say there is none

other than me 19 I have not spoken in

secret in a dark place of the earth

I said not unto the seed of Jacob seek

ye me in vain I am Yahweh who speaketh

righteousness and declare things that

are right than what you always say no is

righteousness and rectitude but if that

righteousness would he is saying we do

not understand then we do not receive

yah was righteousness Jerusalem 2001

this text number 19 says Isaiah 45 19

Spanish Jerusalem 2001 I have not spoken

in secret neither in a dark place of

Earth

I said not unto the seed of Jacob see

Keamy in chaos look for me within chaos

I like that phrase I am Yahweh I say it

that which is righteousness and I

announce that which is right in other

words what yahwah taught us about ie is

the only one and that there's no other

that is important he is one alone and

there is another that is righteousness

and that is right

20 assemble yourselves and come in here

speaking ironically assemble yourselves

you ignorant fools and come draw near

together he that are escaped of the

nation's they have no knowledge that set

up the word of their graven image that

would of their graven image is the cross

it's everything else that's an idol but

beginning with the cross the word and

they that prey into a God that does not

save Wow the praying to God that does

not save because I can pray to many gods

I can pretty the Father the Son the Holy

Spirit I can pitch to Jesus the Son of

God I can pray to Jesus the third or

second of the Trinity whatever but here

it says he doesn't say who's the only

one that saves Yahweh no one else

proclaim and bring them near he's like

come here

that was heads and let them take counsel

together start to consult look at what

the text size or another text make

yourselves encyclopedias take counsel

together who hath declared this from

Bereshit from ancient time who hath told

it from that time have net Aiyaa way

who's the only one that can tell the

future does it say and since when did he

say it since Bereshit that's important

impressive you can read you can read the

entire what's that book of the arabs the

quran the quran you can read all the

other books there's no prophecy

there's no prophecy in the quran why no

prophecy because it's a book that's

false to the ten thousand degree there

can't be anything truther there's no

prophecy the only book in which there's

prophecy and whose prophecies are

fulfilled to the letter is called the

scriptures we have beginning with the

Tanakh and the rest of the books that

are true from the very beginning and

that we've already learned from better

sheet from the very creation yahwah

demonstrates everything do you see

that's what's copying Elohim but not

because he knows the future he says

that's gonna happen there

garden right here in their 1656

apparently there's gonna be some sort of

flood yeah apparently there's gonna be a

flood cuz I'm seen it since I see the

future and I get into the machine and I

see it then I'll write it down here no

no no no no that's not the way do it

works if you think that way didn't you

don't understand a thing

Yahweh causes future to happen he's like

what am I gonna do let's see what should

I do a flood Oh a go ahead and

prophesied since now what else shall I

do I'll go down to earth when will I go

forth millennium I'll go ahead and write

it here I'll go ahead and make the Sun

so that some understand not everybody

that's the way in which Yahweh knows the

future he forms it not cuz he sees it

understand that if you haven't

understood that you haven't understood

scripture cuz many say now cuz Yahweh

looks to the time and then he writes he

looks Oh what's gonna happen over there

is that gonna gonna be saved or not and

us it turns out he was saved I'll ride

him down he's like oh that guy was good

good good what'd he do at the end oh no

I'm gonna take him out of my list now I

can't even write him on my list I was

about to write him down but no no cuz at

the end he liked that one girl from the

outside and he's gone he's left he's

gone I'll delete him I was almost

writing him down do you think that

that's Yahweh hey both programs and cz

no no he programs it he doesn't see it

he programs it and does it when he has

to do it he doesn't see it okay then

I'll write again assemble yourselves and

come journey our together ye that are

escaped of the nations they have no

knowledge they that set up the word of

their graven image and printer God

cannot save proclaim and bring them near

yea let them take counsel together who

hath declared this from Bereshit who

hath told it from that time have not I

Yahweh and there is no Elohim else

beside me wow that is an absolute

declaration there is no Elohim else

beside me not beside us three or beside

us - no no no not three not two

one what I say not really not to you cuz

back in 2011 we used to say it's not

three it's not one but two now what is

it that I'm saying no not three not two

not four one one and there is no Elohim

else beside me I just eloheem and a

savior and what if he is the savior

Elohim then no one can waltz down to

earth and say I am the son of Elohim are

you understanding what I'm saying okay

for now you still haven't understood it

I'm about to explain in a just tell hey

man and Savior and there is none beside

me period but again he repeats it in

case your mind hasn't understood yet if

you don't understand yet he repeats it

again and there is none beside me there

is no other Elohim beside me I just tell

hey man save you there is none beside me

I say away I no one else

Shema Israel yeah well oh hey no Yahweh

had there is none else i isaiah 45:21

jerusalem 2001 and there's a whole

quantity of these mind you i had picked

the ones i wanted to show you today

isaiah 45:21 jerusalem 2001 expose ah

apparently it's the same text i had it

here well the same text that i'm reading

but i'll read in the jerusalem 2001

exposed it's calling all the

Trinitarians the entire world is exposed

present let's go where's your proof what

proof have you got no cuz it says that

they are three there are three witnesses

in heaven in another system no no

baptize yourselves the name of the

Father Son Holy Spirit and another one

says all the texts you would run out

here that was this okay let's see expose

expose present advocate good and bring

your proof

deliberate all of you together you

Christians let's see what you got who

caused this to be heard from ancient

times from better seed and announced

that some time ago have not I Yahweh

Yahweh there

now other Elohim beside me Wow this here

this here this is an attempt against

whatever thing believed by all of

Christendom there is no other eloheem

beside me is that clear enough

I just Elohim and Savior there is none

beside me period

there's none beside me look and to me he

says whom she would look unto unto our

look unto me and be ye saved

wow what if we look unto another right

because the Christians say you've got

Yahweh and then you've got the son of

Yahweh who's Jesus so whom do we look to

the father of the son in whom is

salvation and the father and the son

that gets really complicated right there

and some of the fools is now on the Holy

Spirit because in the spirit he's like

you can insult the father and the son

but don't you dare insult the Holy

Spirit if he as much as utter something

against there's no pardon about a virgin

the Virgin is well don't dare insult her

yahwah says look unto me and be ye saved

where salvation in Yahweh look unto me

and be you saved all the ends of the

earth for I am Elohim and there is none

else but are you listening I'm not

making up any words here it is

absolutely clear yahwah says look unto

me and be you saved all the ends of the

earth for I am Elohim and there is none

else and notice that it's y'all was

speaking long before he comes as Yeshua

to die the salvation of Yahweh does not

depend of the death of Yeshua I've

already demonstrated that why did Yahweh

died on the cross for what reason

because otherwise he would not be able

to marry Israel but this text is way

before he come and what does he say

look at me who I'm at the cross is that

what he's saying because the Christians

are like sent yourselves to the feet of

the cross and they'll go to the feet of

the cross how I love that rugged cross

where my Jesus died and they'll look to

the death of Yeshua as the salvation and

ears is looking to me way before he even

dies look at the me and be he saved

are you following do you think I was a

liar but y'all we need to die to save us

no he says look unto me and be ye saved

who all the ends of the earth whomever

looks at yahwah with her history jew or

not look at me he says do the Christians

look at Yahweh who do they look to third

or second person of the Trinity

they've got Yahweh they've got the son

and they've got the Holy Spirit but what

does you always say look unto me look

unto me and be you saved all the ends of

the earth for I am Elohim and there is

none else I mean it just couldn't be any

clearer

how could Christians ever be turnit

Aryans having these so clear a text it

says their salvation in Yahweh and no

one else

Jerusalem 2001 same text returned unto

me and ye shall be saved all the ends of

the earth for I am Elohim there doesn't

exist

any other well what's it say but men

created others they created the father

son the Holy Spirit they created because

to make things up man is custom made and

created many others as well a law but

there's a whole lot of different

versions but for one Israelite you see

that an Israelite has this well

understood some dumb Kirsten comes along

says gotta believe in Jesus it was Jesus

sound of God no thanks

I believe in Yahweh that's why

Christians are their laughingstock I

believe in yahwah because the christians

don't go to tell him hold on you idiot

yah was the one that came I don't

believe in the Son of God I believe in

Yahweh the one you believing the one you

believe in and when he came you didn't

accept them that's the little problem it

is very clear but I do not believe in

the son of Yahweh the son of yahwah does

not exist

yahwah came if you were to have sent a

son it would have been worth less and to

have accepted him would have been a sin

for what reason for it violates all the

commandments there is so then if the

only Savior is Yahweh there's none else

other than Yahweh if there doesn't exist

any other other than Yahweh obviously

the one who came was Yahweh what the

title say it's right says Yahweh

exactly Yahweh had Yahweh had

23 by myself have I sworn so as to

declare that he's alone that he does not

consult with anyone else he says I have

sworn by myself it doesn't say it by

ourselves have we sworn by myself guess

since there was no other in what he was

doing he swore to himself it's kind of

like everyone you're alone and you say I

swore to myself that I'm gonna do this

but because he's alone if he were

accompanied he'd say I'll swear for this

or that person whatever it says by

myself have I sworn out of my mouth the

word has gone out in righteousness and

shall not return this will never change

are you following Yahweh the Savior look

unto Yahweh that unto me every knee

shall bow every tongue shall swear unto

me not unto us because I mean here and

I'll go slow I don't care if you get

bored because if you get bored you've

got all the Christians out there with

the three and all the rest exactly here

I want to engrave this in your minds

yahwah said there isn't anything else

besides me but I mean he was repeating

it to actually make it clear there's no

one else besides me I made the earth I

alone made it by myself twice were no

other Elohim exists and he says unto me

not unto us unto me shall every knee bow

and every tongue shall swear unto me not

unto my son and we're not to the father

and the son and everybody and their

brother were spending father in the Sun

like we used to think before because we

understood that Yahweh was Yeshua but we

would also insist that they were two not

three not one but two at the end of

every one of our videos that appear but

not any longer and I did the last three

I took it out that's done four that's

over with for what reason was not over

with I believe that more Elohim exists

of course I personally believe that

there's the father of Yahweh the mother

of Yahweh

that's me but does the father of Yahweh

or the mother of Yahweh have anything to

do with us know that we have to worship

them

no the only Yahweh for the human race

which was created by him is Yahweh the

only Allah he momment say the only

Elohim is Yahweh it's not the father of

Yahweh it's not the mother of Yahweh do

they deserve our respect

absolutely eternal respect not worship

why not worship because worship too

sexual

if I deviate worship Yahweh says you're

having sex even if we see sex as it only

being the real sex between a couple but

for Yahweh sex is already worship are

you following if I go in a worship an

idol Yahweh says you're having sex with

that Idol so then if I worship yahwah's

father you know what he's gonna say you

having sex with my father even if he may

not want to have it you're trying to so

then the only Elohim there is is Yahweh

and that's it no one else moving on and

it shall be said about me about me or

about us and it shall be said of me

surely in Yahweh our righteousness and

strength even unto him not unto them

even unto Him shall men come and all

that are incest against him shall be

ashamed against him are they incensed or

Roth they shall be ashamed in Yahweh

shall be justified where are we gonna be

justified in Yahweh and all the seed of

Israel shall be glorified so you see

when the Christians come along and say

you've got to believe in Yeshua you

should the son of whom are you must lost

your mind I believe in Yahweh but dcy

isaiah 46 8 through 13 I'll read from

the bit of the people of God I like this

version you can read whatever versions

exactly the same thing Isaiah 46 8

13 remember this what did say and

comprehend it well so not just remember

because we may remember something like a

lie or remember a misinterpreted text

remember this and comprehended well

think it over in your heart ye rebels

got to do what remember comprehend and

think and while he's at it it causes

what rebels because we are remember the

former things of old for I am Elohim and

there is none else

how many Elohim are there does he say

just him I am Elohim it doesn't say we

are Elohim I am Elohim and there is none

else

I am Elohim and there is none like me no

one like me declaring the end from

better sheep others always say that he

declares things since better sheep and

from ancient times the things that are

not yet done I say my design shall be

complied with and I will do all my

pleasure do you see what he does I say

it's that I see notice he doesn't say I

see and I write but rather he says I say

my counsel shall stand what about my

cancel very different than to say I

write because I see the future he says

my design my plan shall be complied with

and I will do all my pleasure

I will do as I please that's what he's

saying

11:00 calling a revenues bird from the

east and from afar earth country the man

of my design this has many fulfillments

yeah he's talking about that he was

about to throw Jerusalem but he's also

talking about his prophets the man of my

design thus I have spoken it and the sir

will make it come to pass here's the

secret ermine

just just in case he had me doubts he

says thus I spoke thus I wrote and thus

I will make it come to pass you see how

everything that he says from the

beginning he causes it to be done it's

not cuz he saw it but he says I'll write

it down and then I'll make it come to

pass logical okay

logical that's right that's right thus I

spoke it and thus I will make it come to

pass I've traced the plan and thus I

will execute it I mean it's more than

clear so then it's not that he lurks

into the future and he's like oh let's

see what's gone with that guy's it can

be saved

oh he was and why see why am I telling

you all this why am i repeating all this

because many believe that the hundred

and forty-four thousand are people that

he saw that they were to be saved and so

then since he said that they were gonna

be saved

and since he has the capacity to look

throughout at thousands of years then he

writes them down on a list so then she

already knows that they're gonna be

repented since he already knows that

they're gonna ask to be forgiven since

he already knows that they're gonna

comply with his commandments then you

read some of the later then he says yeah

of course I know the future that's why I

wrote him down and those don't make it

well I saw that you were gonna get lost

I can't write it down

that's one wrong way of seeing things

and the other ways to say I will form

what I want I will execute it the way I

want and everything which out right down

here I will do it I will form it and I

will save them whether they like it or

not but obviously I'll form them so they

like it that is obvious it is barely

logical it is barely logical I'm gonna

form them because I'm gonna form them in

a way in which they were like what I'll

do with them so then I'll read again the

size spoken and the so I'll make it come

to pass I've traced the plan and I shall

execute it listen to me you rebels ye

who are far from justice I caused my

justice to draw near she is now far and

my salvation will not tarry I shall play

salvation in Zion and my splendour shall

be for Israel

my splendor my glory shall be for whom

does it say for Israel Wow how

tremendous a text in that Elohim in that

yah was the one we believe in Joel - 27

Joel - 27 and ye shall know that in the

midst of Israel am i how many are there

it's not we are in the midst of Israel

are we is that what it says in who are

we us - or us three Oh is there I am and

that I am Yahweh your Elohim and there

is none else there's another prophet

speak in mind you and there's none else

and again in repeats and there's none

else will you mean there's no there's

none else and my people shall never be

ashamed Hosea

13 for sure which is Hosea 13 for yet I

am Yahweh thy Elohim from the land of

Egypt when did he begin to be yahwah the

eloheem of Israel from the land of Egypt

thou shalt not know another that's what

not know another another Elohim but me

nor any other Savior beside me ever

since it got him out of Egypt tells them

you will never have another Elohim ever

nor any other Savior beside me no one

else so then who is the Savior how is it

that the Christians can say that Yahweh

sent his son can you explain that to me

absolutely no one seems because they've

got images and they're false to say that

is the same thing as is to have an image

of the Virgin Mary I told the same thing

zechariah 14:9 a text which wow they

don't even want to read it many people

don't

Zakhar

14-9 and Yahweh shall be king over all

the earth

yahwah shall be the king over him brawl

the earth in that day

yea we shall beat 1 and it says the word

I had and that day Yahweh Yahweh Elohim

Yahweh shall be one and Ahad his name

once all name that many names

once all name and how many how many

Elohim will there be just one alone but

we could probably tell us or ask

ourselves but there are so many texts

and revelation where it says that there

will be the throne of God and lamb will

study out that but then on this study

but next once because there are many

texts that will start to correct

immediately because I'm tired just like

that I am sick and tired of the

barbarities Bible say is written by the

Romans

I am completely sick and tired of it

that's what I'm given the subject yahwah

says that at the end of time when he

already came died resurrected went to

look for his wife took his wife on a

honeymoon brought her back to earth for

it says that he shall be yahwah over all

the earth we're already talking about

the Eternity on a perfect world at that

time yahweh will be one how many one but

yahweh will be one and one his name we

go back to this Shama Israel Yahweh

Lohan ooh Arlo Haim Yahweh one I had one

Matthew 22 29 Matthew 22 29 then

answered Yeshua and said unto them ye do

er what happens what's your shoe said

they do who's returned up to to the poor

fishermen don't know a thing why James

but what part of just talking - he is

talking to the scribes and the Pharisees

those who interpret the interpreters

those who interpret the law that's what

he's talking about not the poor sinners

don't do a thing he's talking to those

who dedicate themselves to study and

interpret and teach the law then

answering you sure he said unto them ye

do er ignoring how did they are ignoring

the Scriptures and those scriptures is

not the scriptures but the Tanakh

because one would say scriptures might

be mean Paul right some include Paul no

you should st. the Tanakh and the power

love him to things being Nora what do

they ignore the Tanakh and what else in

the power of Elohim okay I've already

demonstrated into you certain parts of

the Tanakh I could add three or four

more pages saying that y'all was one and

there is no more a whole lot of it

especially when Isaiah Jeremiah forget

about it I chose the ones I chose for

this study but to establish one thing

Shema Israel Yahweh Elohim Yahweh HUD

and now let us go ahead and start to

correct certain things let us go to John

14 let's begin with John 14 and I don't

want to make this study too long I think

I've already had if I started then it

began 11:30 or later to live in 45 11:45

12:45

well a little longer let's go I don't

want to make this too long

John 14:1 through 31 let not your heart

be troubled

you sure speaking you believe in the

Lehane believe also in me

there we there we already start to screw

it in no no we start in the wrong food

on the wrong foot if we misunderstand it

but Yahweh how does you

to speak though he speaks in parables so

then right there we've started on the

wrong foot if until this moment you

still believe that you should say and

you believe in eloheem who's up there

then also believe in me if I believe in

an Elohim that's up there and I believe

in you sure how many am i believing in

already two is that well you issue same

because if that's what he's saying then

he's not the true Yahweh what you should

sing let's start from the very center of

this let not your heart be troubled you

believe in Elohim believe also in me

what Yeshua is saying to he who would

understand you guys believe in Yahweh

Elohim that Yahweh Elohim is me believe

in me you see because if you were to not

ignore the scriptures and would know

that there's neither Elohim outside of

Yahweh if you believed in Yahweh believe

in me that I am Yahweh that's what he's

saying

if all the Christians interpret that

there are two there

they've already not understood a thing

and they'll never understand the thing

because if I see two there that is a

violation unto the Torah

are you following is that clear but

peace corrected your Bibles because from

today on later on you play a little

chess and you forget about everything

and then you've got the world cup I'll

forget it before every game repeat Shama

Israel seriously you see a goal repeats

Emma Israel and then the end of the game

Shema Israel if only so us to not be as

affected by football the penis if you

already watched in football there by

that ball then while you watch the

football even if it's our the sport

level repeat the Shema because otherwise

you'll start to create a love for that

ball so then repeat the Shema the entire

time that you're watching that football

and that'll bring you back down to the

eternal truth so then you should says

don't you worry you believe in Elohim

believe in me what is the same I am

Elohim if you today do not correct that

in your Bibles and in your minds a time

goes by and then

oh yeah believe in Elohim believe also

in me there's two up until night you had

seen two there right now you clearly see

him as one yeah if it's not one than you

sure is a lie

not just a liar but someone that comes

to make you break the trough but he is

the try if he is Yahweh Nev already

demonstrated it that he died on the

cross well we've already done known that

since the beginning if he's Yahweh he's

saying he believed in Elohim in what

Elohim does Israel believe in who his

disciples dinner stand the thing we

weren't prepared for this already and

what all they believe and what will he

fall err in Yahweh get it right and

whose father in Yahweh the father of

Israel who is yahwah right they believe

in Yahweh okay if they believe in Yahweh

Yeshua says let your heart not be

troubled you believe in Elohim believe

also in me

naari understand what I'm saying in the

same way believe in me because I am

Yahweh but the disciples were not

prepared they were not prepared to see

Yahweh in person underneath underneath

all that human flesh if he were to tell

him even if he told it to him like he

did even so they wouldn't believe

because the mind was not prepared when

the mind is not prepared one cannot

receive that message

are you following just as if you were to

in the midst of your churches hear the

sermon I don't know about sexuality or

the one against Thailand G white if you

were superfans

Evelyn G white you were not prepared I

remembered that some of you when I said

she's a witch you told me he didn't have

to be so harsh and call her that you

could say that she was wrong but don't

call her a witch because the love was so

great and then if later I say she's a

prostitute oh wow

but if an Adventist were to hear that

what do you think that they do with that

message they reject it straight away

that's it it's over

this is blasphemous southern the

disciples were not they never understood

that it was yahwah those standing there

except for one who was the only

understood that john only one not the

rest let's continue with the text ok so

then you've already understood you

believe in Elohim but write it down in

Yahweh Elohim you believe in Yahweh

Elohim believe that I am that's what

he's saying but he's saying it in a very

special way

in my father's house right there he does

speak about his father he gets he mixes

it's a parable we've got to understand

in my father's house which is also his

house up there many that's until he

moves where's his house up there he was

born in that house he was born in that

house is the house of his father it's

his house so then he can say my father's

or his own house so then in my father's

house are many mansions if it were not

so I would have told you I go to prepare

place for you

there are many mansions in that house

but I've already been prepared he's

already got the perfect traced plan

three and if I go and prepare a place

for you I will come again and receive

you unto myself that where I am there ye

may be also so then here Yeshua promises

that he will come and he will take us to

where he is which is heaven we'll go

there for time and whither I go you know

he already tells him you already know

where I'm going and the way you know it

is very clear you know where I'm going

my father's house up there and you

already know the way told him thousand

times over that he was the way they

don't get it they forget just as you

also forget things

so then Thomas jumps up and says writer

where he says Lord we know not whither

thou goest hidden just tell you Thomas

he misunderstood everything he thought

that the father was Joseph are you

following and if it's not Joseph he

didn't believe them he's like we don't

know where you're going how then can we

know the way you see how he was thinking

about a place on earth where he was

going I'm going to my father's house he

says but we don't know where your father

lives how are we gonna find you there he

did something absolutely not a thing you

should have said I am the way the truth

and the life no man cometh unto the

father but by me the question is what

father do we have to arrive to what is

the

of humanity what father must be get to

the creating father Yahweh there he's

not talking about his father he

interchanges the terms father father his

father father of Israel issue says I am

the father of Israel why because of

Eternal Father Prince of Peace

strong Elohim Eternal Father he created

as is her father

and when he gets married he'll be her

husband he's also our ball for now

the father so then what is your shoes

question here a rather what is you

should definition Here I am the way I am

the truth and the life to them we are

don't have anywhere to go

he's everything you see if he is the way

he is the truth and the life it's not

that through him he takes me to the

Father

no he is the father no one cometh unto

the father but by me exactly no one can

get to know Yahweh Yahweh if not by me

because I am now presenting myself I am

Yahweh but I presented myself another

right in the way of assure I am Yahweh

but if you don't accept me you cannot

get to Yahweh for I am Yahweh do you

follow

that's what happened saw the Jews the

Jews who believed in Yahweh and say they

believed in Yahweh when they look at him

and they don't accept him what they were

doing was missing out on the opportunity

of getting to Yahweh do you follow for

he is Yahweh they can believe in Yahweh

a lot but when yahwah came in a human

form as he was prophesied they said no

that is not the one we're looking for

then no matter how much they believe in

Yahweh whom they say they believe in

that yahwah came to look for them

they didn't want him do you follow it's

as if a person were to court a woman

through the mail and he sent some

letters and letters I love you you're

lovely whatever you want and the girl

falls completely in love and one day

they knock at the door and she's told hi

I'm the one writing the letters no you

can't be it slams the door in his face

she stays in love of the one who wrote

the letters but when the one came she

says you're not the one that wrote

the letters cuz their works were evil

exactly and who did they stay with with

whom that girl that fell in love with

that man stays with whom she keeps the

letters because the person that wrote

the letters she slammed the door in his

face and kicked him out put the letter

exactly that's typical online that's

typical online for example for example

that's typical online typical online so

then this is what we've got to

understand no matter how much we mention

Yahweh no matter how much we mentioned

the Shema

if this Shabbat we do not apply it until

you're sure it is no good unto us do you

follow this Shama talks about Yahweh and

Yahshua is Yahweh so then we could read

the Shama like this Shema Israel Yeshua

Aloha New Year schewe I heard it is not

Yahweh Yeshua

it's Yahweh Yeshua the same person but

now we've got so many names for Yahweh

we've got Yahweh

we've got Elohim we've got Yeshua we've

got you sure how much here we've got my

shear we've got five thousand names

that's why he says that at the end of

times I'll baby how many names for him

one only one name that said it's over

it's just that that name they have yet

to give to us that name is born about

only one person so then the Chaumont

talking about Yahweh in yahwah is Yeshua

if I don't accept Yeshua as Yahweh I

stay without anything I stay without

Yahweh I stay without Yahweh so then the

Jews who bear the Shema here it is no

good to them for they do not accept

Yeshua as Yahweh and they don't have to

accept Yeshua as the son of Yahweh they

don't have to accept Yeshua as a member

of the Trinity they have to accept them

as what he is Yahweh or else they have

nothing do you understand

very well then I like it when you

understand things so then you sure says

I am the way and the truth and the life

I am Yahweh no one cometh unto the

father but by me I am Yahweh's what he's

saying so then if you imagined that

Yahweh will take us to his father you're

very wrong if y'all was gonna take us to

meet his father then he's making his

vial at the trial dear fellow very well

but you're understanding this clearly

right that's why I'm repeating and

repeating y'all was not taking us to his

dad

ya was not taking us to meet his mom you

sure wants to take us to Yahweh who is

he that we understand in the

comprehension that when you're sure it

takes us to Yahweh what he's doing is I

am Yahweh he comes in a different way

that he can die as a man for his wife

but I am still Yahweh I am still the

truth as I always was I'm still the way

of salvation as I always was and if you

accept me you're accepting Yahweh for I

am Yahweh as n96 says for unto well I'll

give you time to look it up Isaiah 9:6

for unto us a child is born unto us a

son is given and the government shall be

upon his shoulder as l96

and his name shall be called wonderful

counsellor the mighty Elohim wait a

Manilla he mother because Elohim could

be one person but that is a very reduced

Elohim not the Worshipful Elohim maybe

just someone with authority but this is

the mighty allure him something else

talk about Elohim who is God so you

understand Elohim is already God mighty

Elohim everlasting father Prince of

Peace these are all titles of yahwah now

the word wonderful do you know what it

sounds like in Hebrew no belly just like

pilet just like pillai from the volcano

the original word in Hebrew of wonderful

is Pele now let me tell you something

called my attention

that's about that that Kilauea volcano

its name Kozma attention Kilauea

it seems like kill a where a wall it

would seem as if to say kill killer

world you see the death of the world

apparently that's what Kilauea sounds

like do you know when kilowatt began

anyone of you know when it bursts it

what we're seeing now when it bursted

the volcanic eruption do you know on

what day anybody you don't know but no

one even cared to find out when it

started it's a strong Hawai but oh uh

one less Hawaiian in the world I wasn't

even planning on vacationing there if I

might say I'm gonna go ahead and cancel

my flight to Hawaii you don't know when

it blew up pass off might be during pass

akka was during the third day of

unleavened bread pisaq was Pesach was

the 14th Pesach was the 14th of Abib

Pesa but it was Monday the 30th

now the 15th of Aviv was Tuesday the

first Tuesday the first of Tuesday the

1st of May that was the first day of

unleavened bread the first day of matzah

second day of mats up was the second

it's precisely the second of May it was

the second day of matzah now the third

day of matzah may 3rd that is where the

volcano blew up during festival or a

mode of Yahweh

I found out Wow that which has not

stopped up until today

and apparently won't stop anytime soon

random meaningful it began during Pesa

because the entire festival of

unleavened bread and soccer Pesa that

entire festival peso began on peso that

right there really calls my attention

for example at Shabbat what we were

talking here while I was giving the

study of the bride of the issue of 21

that volcano kill the world killer world

or Kilauea it's lava kept advancing and

it touched a lake what was the name of

that Lake

do you remember loves believe it's what

Chi Pele something like that the lake

that it is known that it's 400 years old

a lake which is a paradise literally the

most beautiful lake in all of hawaii

kauai appellate name of the lake that

right there was was it was something

that lake was like eden kauai Apella

which means the waters of Pele

Pele's waters Pele we know that in

Hebrew mean wonderful the admirer Bill

Watterson

I read Hawaiian it's as if I'm saying

Yahweh just the acronym how why look at

the way it's written and it would seem

as if it were yahwah i mean i don't know

those are coincidences but what's not a

coincidence because it took place while

I was speaking the lava touched that

precious Lake the waters of play and

touch them and while I was yet speaking

in four hours it dried up the entire

lake just lapped up the waters it took

between three and four hours for the

last drop of water to disappear from the

lake was the new moon lake the waters of

Pele

the waters of Pele Paley's water you

mean tell me that it back parading it

evaporated it Pele in Hawaii in Hawaiian

is the goddess of the volcanoes which is

lava goddess of lava the goddess of lava

because Pele in Hawaiian also means lava

but it's the goddess goddess of lava so

the goddess of lava went in touched this

lake in entirely

it caused sort of an explosions all

evaporated you can look at images to dry

hole I mean wow a lake look at the

before and after pictures but all that

take place while I was speaking when on

what date on 217 where the waters of

Pele dried up the admirer Bowl one

goddess of lava it's interesting

so that Pele when did it start the

admirer Boleyn

because Pele in Hawaiian it's the

goddess of lava in Hebrew it is the

admirable one right of course majestic

admirable in Hebrew but that's what it

means in their language southern in

their Hawaiian language it means God is

the goddess of the volcanoes Oh given

but when did this majestic and marble or

goddess of fire start

during Pesach do you not find that

interesting yes or no very interesting

the next day from that last Shabbat it

caused another apparition another

operation of this Pele in Guatemala that

means since we're already talking about

lavas Pele Pele also appeared there in

Guatemala in that fire volcano what's

the name of that volcano the fire

volcano that fire volcano let's get the

capacity of destroying all of water

malice it E because it is 40 kilometers

it is 40 kilometers away 45 kilometers

away is that what we said or was at 30

kilometers 30 to 35 kilometers so close

it is way too close you know it there

from the city of Guatemala can see it

clearly you can see it smoke what would

it take for that volcano to destroy our

column out of City it's like that Boop

nothing it wouldn't take anything the

body count is at 200 but they say that

it's killed thousands more I mean that's

what they say I wasn't there I don't

want to be there but lava is pretty hot

and it's sweeping everything in its path

do you think that right there is over no

because there are others in activity and

maybe even today

within would still left for shove what

we see more results of than it is very

very interesting what I'm saying

none of you know that that as it turns

out pellet was activated on Pesach while

we were celebrating Pesa now they say

there's some connection with Hawaii they

said there is a connection with Hawaii

they say it's all ring of fire the

entire Ring of Fire is connected now I

mean in the volcanoes all activate then

all Central America wiped out and all of

the activation of volcanoes corresponds

into Yahweh because they got activated

during his festival are you

understanding they were not activated

before his festival of the 70th year not

just any woman

well let's see where this all takes us

to but you already know Pele the

wonderful apparently is making a

separation it is making us a person okay

moving on seven

we're on John 14 seven

we read verse 6 where he says I am the

way the truth and the life no man cometh

unto the father but by me in other words

that father that father who is which is

the desire of Israelite for him to

arrive

Yahweh you are following right yeah

because when all y'all read father of

one Israelite he's not referring to the

father of Yeshua is referring to Yahweh

are you following that concept cuz the

concepts may mix up in our mind now the

father whose father the father of Israel

always whose father father of Israel

farewell then 7 if ye had known me you

see there's a problem you see they don't

know you sure just don't know you're

sure he sure answers Thomas and tells

him if only he knew me if ye had known

me what is Thomas's problem but know him

didn't recognize him exactly if he had

known me ye should have known my father

also why is it that if we recognize who

you shoe is we recognize whom refers to

his father for the same concept

understanding is that Yeshua is Yahweh

if we know Yeshua then forcefully we

know Yahweh because it's the same person

do you follow and that's what he answers

him he speaks in parables if he had

known me ye should have known my father

also and from henceforth since when from

hands forth from henceforth you know him

right there he defines the concept but

even then they didn't understand he says

if only you knew who I am you would know

Yahweh and from now on what's he say he

know him Yahweh they know him they were

look at him right there I'll read again

avy says from henceforth you know him

what is Yahweh saying that they're

looking at Yahweh what are you sure

saying that's what I wanted to say same

thing but they're looking at Yahweh

himself but you see how that concept

there are words that if your mind is

closed even if you pronounce them you

don't understand him they're way over

your head way over your head if he had

known me ye should have known my father

also and from henceforth he know him and

have seen

it is more than clear how many times

that we read this I explained this a

little while back you understood it I'm

highlighting it now but if one does not

understand the Shema if one doesn't

understand everything which I read in

the Tanakh the problem is that you

ignore the scriptures you think that

this is symbolic because just the way

the Sun looks the father looks is what

everybody says you see because his named

the name of Yahweh is in him so then if

the name of Yahweh's in him of course if

we see the Sun then we see the father's

well that's not what you should st. you

should st. from now on you know him and

have seen him

because he's declaring himself to be

Yahweh to whomever will understand and

obviously if only we had the original

words it'd be a lot more easy I don't

even know what the hell they wrote down

here Todd sure there's another word for

it I don't know what they put down here

with the translator do you think the

translator understood what I'm saying

he understood the contrary so then he

molds it to words the articles and

everything else that has to do with the

language to say what he understood but

Yeshua is clearly saying that they're

seeing him doesn't give or take the

translator accommodates this he

accommodates this so as to make himself

understood what the trunks learn

understands that is as otherwise he's

like if this is a whole mess this is

clear it's two people so then I'm trying

for everybody that reads this text to

understand it but if you will I've

questioned that translation rather say

the thing is that it's not the

translation the thing is where the

original is that's why when I speak

about translations I'm talking about the

original nobody has seen the original of

John where's the original Hebrew of John

John didn't read and Greek it was an

embarrassment to write in Greek are they

gonna write in Greek that's where the

dragon are tick control exactly but yah

wait but it starts a blasphemy not me

but the drinking's not gonna do anything

not allowed by Yahweh in this plan

because if see Yahweh plays with the

dragon the dragon might thinks himself

smart but he does everything that y'all

because if this were written straight

the way it is everybody would understand

but the scripture is how conceal it is

concealed their scriptures are concealed

but does Yahweh worried that it's

concealed no cuz he says those who have

to understand I'll make them understand

it clearly the rest let them understand

whatever I commanded the dragon to put

down do you follow okay then southern

Yeshua says and from henceforth you know

him and have seen him

Wow they were seen Yahweh Phillips saith

unto Him Lord another one didn't I still

think here demonstrates then understand

thing lowered stop playing around with

us show us the father already yes you

just got done saying you've seen him and

Philip says what sure was the father and

it suffice with us but you've been

telling us up until now is done but

rubbish what you're saying you're just

playing around with us show us how much

value did you sure have in the eyes of

Philip tell me just a common prophet a

prophet with a lot of power but do you

think that Philip thought that Yeshua

was Yahweh no every Israelite because of

him it was said behold the true

Israelite remember every Israelite or

Jew when they speak of the father they

speak of yahwah eloheem that is very

clear right so then they wanted to see

yahwah eloheem not the father are you

sure they want to see home yeah well

Ohain so then Philip says Lord show us

the father the father Yahweh Elohim

chosen suffice with us he didn't believe

him anything he issues just said ye have

seen him they didn't understand a thing

absolutely nothing Yeshua without the

patience in the world or wrath of the

world or whatever you should have told

them so long have I been with you and

yet has thou not known me Philip he

already told them upset because the

message is clear issue says I am the

father I am here before you in Philips

like Nana nanana shows the father and

that's a fire

but you're saying suffice with us not an

insult not Arthur see those are all the

insults that all of you sometimes saying

don't even know that you're saying him

but their insults do you see about that

because you don't understand something

and your questions already an insult so

then yes sure gets upset in tesam so

long have I been with you I have been

with you

and yet has thou not known me fella he

that hath seen me hath seen the father I

mean it couldn't be any clearer there he

says it in an absolute manner not even

so did the Christians understand not

even so he's clearly saying it right

there if you've seen me you've seen

Yahweh that's what he's saying because

the father is not his father check

yourselves the father is not the father

of you sure it is Yahweh Elohim here

it's talking about the father of Israel

I'll repeat it again because otherwise

your mind does not understand that

father is not the father you thinking of

it is Yahweh Elohim

so then Yeshua says he that hath seen me

hath seen Yahweh Elohim how then saith

thou show was the father Elohim howdy

dear if you've seen him here you

imbecile that's what he's saying he dim

cinema no I mean I mean that's what he's

saying and he's also telling you that

because you've read it 20,000 times over

in her and said it the one that was

there was hope yeah willow him not the

son of Yahweh I'm already sick and tired

at CERN if you out sick of it but with

the Shabbat we understand that he could

never send that son

Yahweh comes in person Yahweh am i the

sign said Yahweh is here Yahweh died and

now he says you idiot I am Yahweh how

can you not see it that's what he's

saying how them saith thou show us the

father Yahweh believes thou not that I

am in the father and here comes the

translations I am in the father but I'll

accept the way it's written and I

understand it believe it or not that

I am in the father and the father and me

the words that I speak unto you I speak

not of myself but the father that

dwelleth in me he doeth the works it is

absolutely clear for whomever will

understand I mean what is job is saying

here

Philip believe it's now not that I am

Yahweh and that Yahweh is in me the

words that I speak unto you

I don't speak them like a human being

but rather it is a Yahoo who's inside I

do the works right of course because

they were looking at a human and ugly on

top of that they weren't looking at a

super attractive human no no pretty ugly

very ugly do you understand what the

text says if you believe that you sure

came through the works of a Yahweh then

the oven understood there's only one

Elohim for all of humanity and there's

no one outside of him once we understand

that concept and that concept forms a

part of our nature then we start to

directly interpret what y'all was saying

yah was not saying the father that lives

in me he does the works that's nobody's

saying he's sane Yahweh who is living

inside of this flesh body that you're

seeing he does the works I am NOT a

common human being everything that I do

I do out of the work and power of Yahweh

which I am that is what he's saying any

doubts on what I'm teaching okay no

doubts then believe me that I am in the

father and the father in me okay I have

to deal with translations I accept that

as this because I don't care but this

here I believe that yahwah said believe

me that i am yahweh and that yahweh is

in me within me that's what he's saying

it's just that these guys changed up all

the articles and they draw it up and it

would seem as if it were something else

the way it's written it's okay believe

me that I am in the father I am in the

father and the father and me he's not

talking about the unity between

his father mind you he's not talking

about the unity of his father who

intended him it's not talking about that

because we could care less about his

father listen to my words I could care

less about his father because if I were

interested in his father I'd be

violating the law as an Israelite I

could care less if he as a father a

mother uncles and a whole family of it I

could care less nothing the very least

just like that I don't care who do I

care about he says look at me not my

father not my father

me says Yahweh look at me I am the

savior of Israel no no we don't want you

we want your dad but what does my dad

have to do with you beating us I'm the

one that created you he says my hands

have created everything I made human

beings I am the Savior I'm the only one

now we want to see your father what do

you mean my father it's only me I am

everything and when I redeem you there

won't be any other Elohim outside of me

only one Elohim only one name is my

message clear enough because many want

me to teach Godhead well that's exactly

what I'm doing now I am directly

teaching the Godhead here

new and improved noon improved adjusted

I'm not teaching anything new but I am

teaching that which is written a bit

more specifically very well then they

are crius just one thing remember I told

you who did I say would jump and ask

whom did I say we jump and ask who said

tonello I mean it starts out more and

more like that cult only J's is that

Jesus the father Jesus is everything but

am i teaching that Jesus the Father and

Jesus everything mean your way Yahweh

Yahweh is the son of a being yahwah is

the son of a certain being and that

according to creation he has a father

and a mother and that Yahweh is an only

Son and he's alone the same who said I

will make my own creation but I'm also

gonna make my own wife so then from that

to it being only Jesus only Jesus when

Yahweh would pray

the only Jesus folks say that he was

talking to himself there's a difference

because Yahweh as a father the only

Jesus folks say that yahwah has no

father that yahwah has nobody and when

he came heaven was left empty

that's only jesus folk when he please

know how to differentiate thanks when

the only jesus folks think that you sure

came heaven was left empty and

afterwards a pantomime when he would

pray he was praying but he was actually

making a whole theater of that prayer

that's what the only jesus folk believe

that's what they believe in but it is

very different to what we absolutely see

in scripture only thing I'm saying is

that everything that has to do with

creation Redemption salvation and

eternal life of human beings there is

only one Elohim who is Yahweh no one

else now the fact that Yahweh has

parents that's a different story but the

father does not come to interact with us

because the father has these kingdom

it's in heaven the one who comes and

interacts with us is our Creator that's

why Paul is a false wicked apostle who

said however unto us there's one salt

Elohim who's the father of whom all

things proceed and one soul Lord

goryeo's he took him down a level Elohim

courteous one only courteous Lord who is

Yeshua by means of which all things are

but all of us are for the father not for

the courier's but for the father that is

another Christian theory farewell then

I'll read on Allah believer rule 11 11

12 believe me that I am in the father

which is what we're reading in the

father and me believe me that I am the

father that's what is saying the father

is in me inside of me what you're

looking at is a human being but who's

inside

who's it

it is your father yahwah or else believe

me for the very works sake if you don't

believe me for what i'm saying how do

you think that i do the works cuz

whatever human being can do works

novello him doesn he makes him do it if

i say moses moses raised up his stuff

like this and parted the Red Sea and Wow

then Moses arla him no no Moses is not

our Elohim he struck the rock and water

came out but was it the power of Moses

that did all that no but here you should

saying that what he did he did it with

the power from within that's why he says

alright again believe me that I am in

the father and the father is in me we

are the same person yahwah and i for

else if you don't believe me for what

I'm saying believe me for the works sake

for the very works that I do which are

not over human being not that an angel

comes and doesn I do them you if you

don't believe my words look at what I do

whether or not I'm yahwah or not that's

what he's saying

all the sudden he says tells the sea to

get still who's the only one could do

that stop a storm who's the only one

that can say that Yahweh only yahwah can

do that no one else I mean all the

miracles he did to resurrect Yahweh

believe me for the very works sake 12

verily verily I say unto you I truly

truly tell you he that believeth on me

the works that I do he shall do also and

even greater works than these shall he

do for I go unto the father what does

this text mean within of course all the

bad translations what it saying is as

follows if you really and truly believe

that I am Yahweh that I am Yahweh the

worst you're gonna do are even greater

but what do you have to believe in first

that is Yahweh that is Yahweh not that

you

always with him because I mean yahwah

could be with anyone even with my dog my

dog could become ultra powerful just

like in the movie the mask right because

if yahwah possesses my dog he'll be a

super dog you could destroy everything

but that's not the point the point is to

believe that Yeshua is Yahweh not that

Yahweh gives him power but rather that

he is Yahweh verily verily I say unto

you he that believeth on me did that

believeth how like a savior know like

Yahweh exactly do you see the difference

he that believeth on me that I am Yahweh

the works that I do he shall do also and

even greater works than these she shall

do because I go unto my father I go unto

the father to things he could be saying

if it's well translated since I am

leaving until my father possibly he may

be talking about his father I'm going to

my father and you'll be left doing the

work or directly as I am the father

originally I do not know I am guiding

myself by what I can understand here but

my guide is this in the entire Tanakh I

haven't care but the father at all so

he's going to the father or not that's

what I could care less about I believe

in him as Yahweh now what he does I

could care less about so then how do I

understand this text because I am Yahweh

is what he's saying and if I'm leaving

unto my father

I will leave power for you are you

following 13 and whatsoever ye shall ask

the Father in my name here it is a

direct violation I care less about we

believe him look whatever you believe in

to me it is worth Jack very little

what's worth to me is what I believe in

what I believe in because the only one

that can do anything for my salvation is

I if I believe in Yahweh if all of you

believe in yahwah and I don't good is it

to me so then I don't care about what

you believe in what you understand I

care less what I care about telling you

is that whatever violation here is

repugnant if here it says whatsoever you

shall ask the father how the heck am I

gonna pray unto the father of Yahweh if

he's got nothing to do with me

nothin to do with me absolutely nothing

to do with me that'd be a violation and

illicit sex to ask the father of Yahweh

being as the father of Yahweh did not

create me he did not create you he never

came down to earth he never designed it

or made it because I talked to Xander

that here there's only one designer and

that's whom Yeshua Yahweh so then if you

still have the stupid idea that I'm

gonna pray in to the Father because it's

written here I don't give a damn about

what's written I don't give a damn about

what's written because Shema Israel

Yahweh Elohim Yahweh had if I break that

rule I break away from being an

Israelite I'm gonna pray to someone else

yeah I believe in Yeshua but I'm gonna

pray to the father of Yeshua so that

Yeshua will bless me what the heck am I

saying I could care less what text you

bring me because it says you pray to the

Father you should sell it if you believe

that garbage then you'll never follow

Yahweh ever for Yahweh is one and

another does not exist and I don't care

about his father is it clear what I'm

saying I could care less about his

father not interested in him

I don't worship his father are you

understanding or you not cuz maybe in

your mind you say let's Christian Sain

whatsoever ye shall ask of the father

and always as Christians we used to pray

unto the father father gave us your son

the heck is the fire can give us his son

tell me tell me the back is gonna give

us what's he gonna give us if you came

here looking for a Christian preacher

tell it to worship the father of the son

unto our how does the Adventist

invocation go unto our Father heavenly

what does it take unto the son our

Redeemer

the Holy Ghost our counselor there you

have it the Father the Son and the Holy

Ghost that is an abomination

totally pagan but taking out that pagan

abominations if I say father send us

your son Yeshua that is the very same

abomination are you following what I'm

saying yup the very same one if I have

three or I have two versing one here

there's only one Elohim once all paths

once your father once all Yahweh once

saw Elohim Chima listen O Israel Yahweh

our Elohim Yahweh alone and if y'all was

one I print a yaw way not into the

father of Yahweh whom do I pray to

Yahweh southern Yeshua says here and

whatsoever ye shall ask the Father my

name who is the father asked you I would

my name of course we've got to pray to

Yahweh in whose name

understanding that yah was Yeshua or

else it's no good just like that not at

all your prayer is absolute garbage if

you ask a being in the name of another

being when the Torah and the Shema say

there's only one being so then I ask

that what only being in the name of that

one only being and why why did you just

say that it is so important to pray in

the name of Yeshua because if I don't

pray in the name of Yeshua what I'm

saying is that I don't accept that

yahwah came under the name of yeshua the

israelites praying to Yahweh Yahweh

Yahweh and you're sure oh no that guy's

a false son of the Roman in the

prostitute

are you following so then I pray in to

Yahweh in the name of Yeshua because I

am accepting that yahwah came and then

the name of Yeshua

if I don't pray in the name of Yeshua I

am saying I don't accept he came as

Yeshua are you following that doesn't

mean that I am praying in the father of

Yahweh in the name of Yeshua I'm praying

to the same being

and in the worship I accept that Yahweh

became Yeshua to save his wife are you

following this so then the father of

Israel and whatsoever ye shall ask of

the father

what father Yahweh Elohim in my name

because I am

if you accept me I will do it who will

do it the father or who y'all ways but

Yeshua says I will do it he doesn't say

my father will do it who does he say

will do it so then why do we have parent

to the father for him to do it but it's

a whole communication Lord your son who

is the path of life I'm praying to you

though please tell your son to do things

for me you see how we don't understand

it and how difficult was it for us to

understand that because I remember you

here

oh no we've got to pray to the Father

get a parent to the father in the name

of Yeshua and all the Christians pray

unto a being in the name of another

being you notice that right he's just

clear and I'm going slow here because if

you shoulda come and look for us it's

gonna come and look for people that have

it clear not that they doubt that they

have cloudy doubts in their mind they

bring to the father father forgave me

because I insulted your son so then we

still have all this cloudiness like that

no no no more cloudiness today I could

care less about the father

I don't worship the father the father

fed me the day I marry is sure or Yeshua

takes me he'll be like look this is my

father and mother but they today haven't

the least bit of relation with me zero

and if in my mind someday I understood

that there was a small relation between

me and the father of Yeshua I'll break

it today you know why because if you

don't break it this Shama you'll never

understand it

never ever Shaima Israel Yahweh our

Elohim yahwah is one it's not the father

and not the age one the rest are made of

wood just like that of wood the worship

the father is just a sinful us to

worship the Virgin same thing who the

heck is the

it is the mother of Yeshua yes or no

this should deserve worship I could care

less about the Virgin the Catholics who

worship Jesus and his mom are in the

same mistake of all of us of worshiping

Yahweh in his dead are you getting this

is so deep if any one of you of the

eternal truth has any type of secret

worship or in your twisted mind and have

not understood up until today if you

haven't understood up until today

that we do not worship the father not

the very least it is time for you to

correct that when I pray I pray unto

Yahweh if I say father

it means Yahweh yahwah's father I could

care less about just like Mary and the

very least and very least I don't care

about him is that clear ok so then you

sure says and whatsoever ye shall ask of

Yahweh in my name I will do that the

father that yahweh yahweh be glorified

in the son who is the son at yeshua so

then the only way is to unite Yahweh

with yeshua that yahweh may be glorified

in the son that is what it means it is

so that it is precisely understood that

it is the same person and that's the

only way of being glorified to

understand that yeshua hamashiach is

Yahweh when I understand that you show

HaMashiach is Yahweh I don't worship

Yeshua HaMashiach and Yahweh and y'all

was father and the Holy Ghost and

whoever else no I don't worship Yahweh

in Yeshua mind you know I worship Yahweh

whose name is also Yeshua so then it

isn't even Esther say whether you sure

Salah him right because the only Jesus

folks say you sure is not eloheem the

father is Allah him not him

it is no longer necessary to

and say that Yeshua's got right you sure

it's the only God that exists there is a

difference not whether you sure is God

Yeshua is the only Elohim for Israel

that there exists no more

there's not another to remember all the

texts we read the beginning if you don't

remember stop this video if you're

watching the video and go back and it

says no other Elohim exists and if no

other Elohim exists if Yahweh himself is

saying there isn't another how will I

pray to another it breaks what Yahweh

said are you understanding this there

doesn't exist another that other one is

the lie of Christianity very well then

verse 14 says Eve II shall ask anything

in my name in what name are we to ask

things in the name of Yeshua because

when we ask in the name of Yeshua we

give the glory unto Yahweh for what

reason for yah was the one that came we

recognize that yahwah came that is

what's important and the secret of

understanding this by mentioning Yeshua

I am accepting that Yeshua is Yahweh if

I only mention Yahweh and I never

mentioned Yeshua

it's as if to say yea I worship Yahweh

but the issue I don't know that is might

be the son or whomever of God sent or

the anointed the mashiac if you will

know when I pray I pray it's you see

it's you can pray with Yahweh but

obviously if you understand that it's

Yahweh and who you sure is you have to

unite that if to unite that put it

together farewell then so then if you

shall ask anything in my name I will do

it who will do things always Yahweh

exactly Yahweh Yahweh yeah sure Yahweh

who was Yeshua 15 if you love me keep my

Commandments why why did you sure say

that he said it because he Yahweh was

gonna die and by dying he was gonna

unrolled the matrimonial contract so

then since he was gonna annul it there

was no longer an obligation of keeping

anything

there isn't there's not an obligation of

giving tides there's no obligation of

keeping the Shabbat there isn't there's

no obligation only if we love Yahweh who

said that obey that's what he said if

you love me keep my Commandments but

wait hold on a moment

how many Commandments did ye assure give

that are written there how many if he

said that he came to confirm the law of

Moses he came to confirm it so then but

here he is saying that the law the law

all the commandments the myths votes of

Israel of Yahweh are his do you see who

gave them he did because they're his he

says now he's going since they're his

he's the only one that can know them

because he's about to die do you see

well do you understand that already

southern it says now if you love me keep

them there's no obligation I will break

them and we already see that with what

happened later I will break them but if

you love me keep my Commandments no

matter if I break the contract I am

doing it so that I can again marry

Israel or else I cannot take you unto

myself you see how he said I'll take him

to myself I will take him to myself as

my wife is what he's saying I will take

you unto myself unto myself I will take

you unto me as a wife that's what you

sure is saying but we now have to do it

out of love out of love that's why when

the prophet Elijah comes

what does malachi say he says remember

what the law of Moses my servant which I

gave in Horeb why does she always say

remember the law because the law is no

longer in effect and he says but

remember the law don't forget it

I annulled the law with the reason of

being able to remarry but now you have

to keep it out of love

remember the law so about 2000 years the

world spent without law it's been 2,000

years without law ever since he died no

law without law that is why everybody

the entire world will be judged without

that law remember my

words the whole world will be judged

without that law the law whereby the

judge are the works the works of

everyone and what the person knew those

right and wrong it is clear that Noahide

laws we could say is that what you said

what did you say it knows law okay you

didn't say that there is another law in

effect which is the law of Noah the laws

that gave Noah with those laws it is

enough to judge the entire world without

law was words exactly my words shall be

convey exactly by your words and works

your works but no longer for not keeping

this Shabbat not for all the things

which we already know that the law of

Moses condemns we only out of love to

Yahweh do we keep that law because we

love Yahweh and we love his law that is

what we do it

farewell the display says if you love me

keep my Commandments and I will pray the

father and he shall give you another

comforter that he may abide with you

forever here the three shalt the

Trinitarians I they say that's one shall

pray to the Father let's - he shall send

them yet another comforter that is three

here are the three farewell them go back

to what we've got as as center of our

being which is the shimma shimma Israel

Yahweh Elohim Yahweh HUD so then when

Yeshua says and I will pray unto the

Father and he shall give you another

comforter that he'd be with you forever

the original translation we do not have

but at this point time I don't even care

I know that Yeshua who's Yahweh will

never violate his own law ever if he

himself said that there is another being

outside of me so then what it is written

here I have to understand it give or

take

through the translations and what

possibly could have been added

what do I understand here the way it's

written because I I will understand it

forcefully I don't care what is written

I will understand it as if I had the

nature of the Shema one alone and never

another ever so then I will pray unto

the Father

I'll praying to the Father what does

that mean the father of Yeshua has

nothing to do with this creation so then

what does he have to pray to the Father

for a via schewe

listen well if yeshua who is the creator

of the world he created what he wanted

and he says I do my plants and I execute

him the way I want to what does he have

to play into the Father if he can send

another I mean I want you to understand

once you understand that to knock in the

beginning how can you understand this

text I will pray in to the Father first

of all he clean unto the father father

the world didn't turn out all that well

yeah it's a bit off can I send another

but that about sending another no one's

gonna listen to that because there's

Abbas is that there's only one alone we

don't accept another and to top it off

to confer fame exactly top to top it off

to console them this text is in my point

of view extremely easy to understand a

tional parent of the father what he's

saying don't worry don't you worry i who

am yahweh will comfort you in a

different way just like that that other

comforter is another way of comforting

that's the only thing he's saying and he

explains it later what I say now is what

the text should say don't you worry

if you love me keep my Commandments

don't you worry I will comfort you in a

different way and I will be with you

forever that is what he's saying what

they wrote here I could care less

because if I find violation unto the

Torah then it's no good I know that

y'all was speaking there and I know I

know

and I predict what he's about to say why

can I predict because he gave a law he

gave a law and he said you will never

know I am the eloheem that God

out of Egypt and you will never know

another so then if I've got that

recorded in my marrow and I mean

recorded in my marrow if you are married

to a woman and the husband leaves and he

says look I will never send you another

I will come to give you the messages so

then later somebody comes along and says

Houston sent me now if my woman has

recorded what I told her she won't

believe a word he says

do you follow that is just a minimal

example Yahweh who traces his plan the

way please ever agree to how did you do

it and then what does it do with that

plan he executes it it makes it come to

pass so then he doesn't have to pray

anything of the father father things

didn't turn out all that well send

another in my place to cover these

children who need comforting no

absolutely not so then I pre what if

y'all was speaking I know that Yahweh

will always show me that there's no one

else beside him so then if he tells me

another comforter but he's telling me is

in a different way don't you worry

I shall comfort you in a different way

and I will be with you forever

and that I will I will demonstrate it

well how these texts are about the Holy

Spirit but I won't read it at this time

because they are not needed and they

don't matter and I no longer have to

demonstrate anything to you I'm already

sick of always having to say you see how

it says here Parakletos and the

Parakletos means comforter and no no no

that doesn't go with me anymore

I don't have to demonstrate anything to

you this my only demonstration there's

my only demonstration if you want to

believe that it's another yep believe it

I care less what you believe in I've

told you how much do I care what you

believe in

nothing if you want to believe in

another go ahead if you want to believe

that he's paying it to the father father

father and send him another go ahead be

my guest but I know Yahweh and if I know

Yahweh he doesn't have to pay anything

of the father because he's the father of

us exactly so then and to top it off

he's speaking in parables why does he

speak in parables confuse so that they

don't understand so as to confound I

like the way you said it he says I speak

in parables to confound that they don't

understand and they be confounded

because I don't want to save them he's

because I'm

but if they understand then I'd have to

save them are you following so then of

course it said yeah I'm gonna pray into

the father and the people are like oh

look there are three there three he can

save those people but he cannot save

them as his bride that's what he's

talking about

are you following he'll save them that's

why see he could care less if they

believe in three four five or six they

will be judged according to their works

no matter if there were the pagans

almost pagan people there exists that

even said God does not exist that's fine

but you'll be judged according to your

works did you steal oh you did steal

don't you you knew pagan and all that

you didn't have to steal you did right

there you're being condemned because you

stall not because you didn't believe in

Elohim do you understand I mean that is

more than clear it's absolutely clear

southern I don't have to demonstrate

anything to anybody

once I know that Shama and that now you

will start to practice it every day when

you get up when you get a bed write it

in your car put a little sign up in your

car and put it in Hebrew

cuz it's nice Shema Israel yeah willow

hey no Yahweh I had tell the truth those

words right there don't need translation

yes or no we start to understand them as

if they were our own language it's as if

it were directly in English

it just sounds natural Shama yoshiyama

means to listen here listen

Shem Israel are we Israel obviously it's

not talking to the world whose dog - or

is it about Christianity no no shame

Israel yeah willow hey no Yahweh our

Elohim Yahweh is one that's it let's

memorize that and repeat it and let us

love Yahweh with all our heart our body

and our mind farewell then so then let

us go directly I just read 16 and I will

pray unto the father and he shall give

you another comforter that he may abide

with you forever

it is another way of speaking very weird

that could deceive the Christians but

not me because it's imperil and all he's

saying is I will comfort you in a

different way just like that I will

comfort you in a different way the

Spirit of Truth that I heard he started

to speak to the member will understand

who is the Spirit of Truth who said I am

the truth so then if Yeshua and Yahweh

is the truth then the spirit of yah was

the one that's coming no one else he

doesn't have to pray to anybody the

spirit of Yahweh because he says the

Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot

receive why can't they receive him

because it seeth him not neither knoweth

him of course the one that's coming the

world cannot receive because they don't

seem nor know him but ye talking to the

disciples not to the Christians but he

know him but now he's talking to us why

do we know him for he dwelleth with you

who was their darling with them Yeshua

Yeshua than you sure after saying what

he said which kid confused millions just

like that millions could be confounded

by that millions then he talks to the

disciple says hold on what I said you

have to understand it that was to

confuse minions because he says I speak

unto you in with parables I'm not making

anything up here did you sure not say I

speak to them in parables that they'd

not understand then he says for those

whom should understand whom the world

cannot receive yahwah does not want to

be received by that people so then that

people yeah of course the Holy Spirit

only goes yeah I was like and that's all

good in the bag of chips and nothing do

with them whom they'll be jerks mind you

they will but he does not want to have

any relation with them are you following

this ok then because he understands our

personal relation with him with Yahweh

as sex you already know now you've

gotten to understand it to a depth that

never before you understood the worship

of Yahweh's sexual so then yahwah does

not want to have sex with the rest and

believe in that other one all y'all in

that other guy the Holy Ghost and all

that stuff that there 3 therefore there

too whatever but you know that I am the

only one that's why he says that

dwelleth the Spirit of Truth whom the

world cannot receive he is saying that

Yeshua is the world cannot receive him

so then stop expecting a rain of Holy

Spirit unto everybody but rather what

only unto the elect whom the world

cannot receive because it seeth him not

neither know him they will never see him

but also not what know him

and the only one that will know him are

actually those who understand

these eternal truth that is why there's

a bride that is why this this year has

to be recorded in our minds in order to

know the Holy Spirit or the rock ha

kodesh we've got to understand this that

there's only one whether spiritual where

there humanly whether visibly how many

other one if there's another coming that

other one does not belong to us exactly

that other ones that belong to us the

only one that can penetrators with his

Spirit is one his name is Yahweh and he

came in the form of yeshua and he says

that he will come back in a spiritual

way so don't you worry the world will

never see him because they cannot

receive him because they don't know him

nor see him but ye know him for he

dwelleth with you and shall be in you

difference at that moment you sure is

telling him he dwells with you obviously

I am already told you I am the father if

you've seen me you've seen the father

I'm not dwelling with you but I will

dwell in you but I'll draw in you you've

got to comprehend that I am it's today's

message clear enough that they have you

taken out the father of Yahweh out of

your lives because it is time to retire

yahwah's father from your lives okay

some of you may still be like I parent

to the father no no no the father is

Yahweh the only one there is for us for

us okay then look at what it says in

John 1 10 and 11 John 1 10 and 11 the

very same thing I've just read that it

says the world cannot receive him for

they do not see him nor know him but he

know him and if we go to John 1 10 to 11

it says he was in the world who was in

the world was it the son of Yahweh was

in the world who was in the world Yahweh

was in the world was he and the world

was made by him that John understand who

he was did Philip understand who he was

no he didn't in the world was he and the

world was made by him

yet the world knew him not oh wait a

minute what happened and what about now

does the world know him no they still

don't know him they still don't know him

in the world was he and the world by him

was made yet the world did not know him

unto his own he came what do you mean

unto his only came whom did his robe

belong to Yahweh he came into his own

yahwah did who formed a forever a - from

isaiah who's the former and maker of

Israel Yahweh so then it says unto his

own he came why are they his own because

he formed them and to his own his came

and his own received him not

whom did they not receive the Son of God

whom did they not receive they didn't

receive Yahweh so then no matter how

much I worship Yahweh as an Israelite if

I don't receive yahwah when he come what

good is it to me absolutely nothing at

all

just like that zero zilch that is why

it's so important that we comprehend

today today a world in the 24th of zev

today that the Creator Lehane Yahweh set

out is the only vain that we worship and

that beings the one that came he is the

creator and he came to the world in the

world did not receive him he came to his

own in his own did not receive him 18 I

will not leave you as orphans I will

come to you that declaration right there

is ignored by all the Trinitarians they

went with this per se the

sleight-of-hand they went with the

slight of hand of the other comforter

and they deviated already another

comforter here's just a net third

they're like it's a feather and jumping

off a parent of the father

you've got the three right there all

right the father he sent another you see

a three it's three okay that's fine it's

three four you verse 18 says I won't

leave you as orphans what to say I will

come to you

I will come to you so then all of

Christianity who left who left with the

other one here clearly it says another

one isn't coming I will come unto you

I'm the one that's coming into you yeah

a little while and the world seeth me no

more

does anyone see our way no one sees

Yahweh do we see Yahweh but we see him

in a spiritual way not visibly yet a

little while and the world seeth me no

more but ye see me because I live ye

shall live all so you sure here makes a

magnificent declaration he says yet a

little while and the world will no

longer see me they won't understand a

thing but ye shall see me why do we see

him because we understand who he is

are you seeing this are you seeing what

I'm teaching so then you're seeing the

truth you've seen Yahweh if you see

Yahweh how he came and many shall be

called Yahshua you've seen Yahweh when

you're sure says my father he's talking

about him except for some exceptions

which I'll teach because I live because

I am Yahweh ye shall live also that part

about because I live is because I am

Yahweh ye shall live also that is the

only chance we have for us to believe

that

yah was about is Yeshua HaMashiach that

is what we pray unto us about and we

remember his name when he came down here

which is Yeshua on that day when does he

say on some day in the future at that

day ye shall know that I am in my father

he is sure knew that they had not

understood they had understood because

if they had when Yahweh died they would

not have all gone their way right if it

was Yahweh buried there imagine Yahweh

lies here what Israel was left Elohim

ulis right there did you know that for a

moment three days and three nights

there was no Elohim on earth that's

interesting

Israel was left Elohim bless that's just

this road but the entire world was left

without eloheem the entire world yes

Elohim died that's interesting right we

know that he cannot die but we've got to

accept that Elohim died but that Elohim

also resurrected in three days so then

for three days and three nights we were

without eloheem just like that el

homeless at they didn't understand a

thing of whatever you said nothing at

all because if they had he resolved

you already know this at that day ye

shall know that I am in my father he

said someday in the future someday in

the future you will note that I am

Yahweh that is why he's saying I'll

repeat this because that I am in the

father what does that mean that I am in

the father what it means is that the

father yahwah eloheem am i that is what

he's saying did I get this mixed up I'm

not saying that he does not have a

father that has nothing to do with the

fact is there understood clearly what I

speak you see Israel has no relation

with the father of Yahweh okay at that

day ye shall know that I am in my father

that I am Yahweh Elohim that's what he's

saying and ye and me we have to have

Yahweh and Yahweh is in us ye in me our

only hope of eternal life resides in

understanding that Yeshua is Yahweh and

there's no one else and that the rock

glacial Holy Spirit is Yahweh he in me

and I in you and I in you who will be in

us he will but this goes further because

here there's a great concept if at that

day we shall understand that Yahweh save

out he's reassure HaMashiach clearly as

we understand it today

afterwards he says we shall be in him

and I in you he's saying that someday

our nature will be his as well the same

thing we've been studying throughout

everywhere and that the only one that

can possess us possess us in all aspects

is called Yahweh about Yahweh about 21

he that hath my Commandments and keepeth

them again he repeats just in case

there's a couple coolest folk around

there somebody disclosed my said now

it's been an alt he that hath my

Commandments and keepeth them he it is

that loveth me and he that loveth me

shall be loved of my

father and I will love him and will

manifest myself to him

okay he that loveth me he that loveth

you Shu HaMashiach shall be loved of my

father what's he talkin about here do we

need his father's love I can assure you

we do not need his father's love his

father's not gonna live with us so then

his father's love we don't need him what

he's seen here and we go back to the

same thing if we love you sure

HaMashiach yahoo loves us but we have to

love you sure HaMashiach as yahweh it's

all related and it is set forth in

parables that the world does not

understand but if all this were very

clear if I were to write all this in and

if if I were to write John and I make

people understand that it's the original

of John everybody would correct their

well at this stage it's impossible what

I want to say is if John were written

the way I am writing it who would doubt

of this no one

they'd perfectly understand that Yahweh

is Yeshua and there's no such thing as

the Holy Spirit the third person of the

deity and that the father has nothing to

do with us so then the whole world would

understand so then how with the words I

speak to them in parables that they did

understand be fulfilled

maybe issue says why are you clarifying

this so much Chris I left it like that

but exactly I do not worry because those

who should not listen to me don't listen

to me and if they do they get even more

upset about what I'm saying

there like he is crazy now he's got the

authority of correcting what is written

that's why I don't have any problem with

it not a problem with it but those who

really want to understand this and

clearly see it don't have to understand

because I say it they clearly see it in

the Shema they clearly see it in the

entire Tanakh which serves only one God

you'll never have another that's it it's

absolutely clear I am only correcting in

in your scriptures what it says here

so then I'll read again he that hath my

Commandments and keepeth them he it is

that loveth me and he that loveth me

shall be loved by Yahweh it's what I say

not by my father by Yahweh and I will

love him and will manifest myself to him

it is exactly written in parables but

wait

hold on who manifests himself it says I

will manifest myself to him who will

manifest himself Yeshua you sure

speaking it's Yeshua not another so then

all the ones I got deviated with the

other one can they understand this they

can no longer understand it because

there was a huge enormous path like this

yeah you sure says perdition which now I

explaining that is perdition but the

white path the easy one that one through

that my wife doesn't go through there my

wife is going on a special path that the

white path that's where everybody can go

those who I don't want as my wife can

take that path directly there so then

they're like another another they all go

there but my bright comprehends what I'm

saying

my wife comprehends what I am saying

because there are secrets you see how

there are secrets between the wife and

the husband there are secrets different

now if there's no secrets that's not a

good or exemplary matrimony those

secrets are the ones that you should

says I speak in parables to the rest but

my wife understands my words that is

what is precisely what he's talking

about and I will manifest myself to him

so then the one who's gonna manifest

himself to console us in a different way

is not another meaning but it is Yeshua

Yahweh 22 Judah said not Iscariot not

Iscariot Judas Lord how is it that thou

wilt manifest thyself unto us and not

unto the world right because Judas had

understood everything and maybe it was

better translated written more clearly

but Judas understand all that the

understanding today like that he

understood that will he asks Lord are

you gonna do it to manifest yourself to

us who believe in you and not to the

rest they'll see you that's what Judas

is saying are you gonna do it I don't

get it

notice the Judas does not ask who will

manifest himself who is that other one

you see the restaurant with the other

one but Judas who understands there's no

other that it is he he says how are you

gonna manifest yourself it is more than

clear how are you gonna manifest

yourself and allow us to see you but not

the world how's that

you sure entered and said he that loveth

me for the third time he repeats he that

loveth me my words he shall keep once

again he repeats if we love ya what do

we have to do keep his word do we know

that the contractors are not completely

annulled cuz y'all would died for three

days it was a note and in fact he just

three days just to make it clear there

was no nap right because the people say

now that guy died only five minutes half

a day a day now to this very day there

are dead people that wake up a day later

you see they were at the morgue they

were at the morgue and they woke up the

next day well he was there for three

days three days and he came out of his

tomb three days we were without eloheem

Israel Elohim 'less you sure answered

and said unto Him he that loveth me my

word he shall keep and my father will

love him once again we start with the

great dramas and problems with Scripture

and my father will love him and we will

come unto him and make our abode with

him once again here this time it all got

screwed up the Shema screwed because he

says we will come unto him that's at

least two maybe not as far as to say

three but at least two they say the

father and I now we've got to to double

penetrate us

he's just don't laugh - he says the

father and the son southern if yet the

third one then it's got the

three-quarter inch and say it's three

so then L&G white i've read to you from

the pen of that prostitute broad Ellen

White says she explains this text and

says this is equivalent to the Father

Son Holy Spirit I would explain to you

in fact then think I Jolene I read it to

you once

remember that Angelina it was a text I

clearly remember it I made Angelina read

it that said this is equivalent to the

Father Son Holy Spirit we shall come

unto him and Ellen writes this means the

father of the son whole spirit and you

can throw the Virgin Mary in there I

mean who knows for us to be penetrated

let all the angels come let everybody

come right let them welcome a lot of

people like to have a gangbang type of

penetration let us know what the Shema

says is she message that we can only be

penetrated by one alone who is it Yahweh

one alone Yahweh that's what we are to

love

southern what the hell do we have here

and why do I use those horrible words

why not just what does it say here

because otherwise your mind first of all

to let you know that I'm not Christian

and second of all that you receive this

message directly that this is a bad

translation or it's a parable of Yeshua

why does he use parable to confuse but

the fact that this is not written the

way it's here it's not the way it's

written here because the father and the

son cannot come are you following okay

Yeshua answered and said he that loveth

me will keep my words there he started

with that already he defined everything

which is the word starting with the

Shema the Torah if I keep this word of

Yahweh that says Shema Israel Yahweh

Elohim Yahweh had one alone so then

already he that loveth me keepeth my

word and my father will love me that

part about my father will love him I

care less about his father well I do

care but I'm understanding that I don't

place him here in what is written that

father is Yahweh because he speaks in

parables my father will love him and we

will come unto him and make our abode

with him both of them abide No this text

is absolutely clear according to the

Torah do you know what this text the way

it should be read and I don't care the

words written because she always speaks

in parables

it says Yeshua answered and said he that

loveth me keepeth my word he will start

to keep Torah the one who loves me and

if in fact would keep Torah we have to

repeat this every day

and will no longer be confused and

Yahweh will love him and I will come

unto Him and make abode with him that's

all has been saying above all time I

will not leave you as orphans I will

come into you so he does not come as a

group he comes if maybe Yahweh what I

believe yah we didn't even say this this

was added by the Catholics we shall come

unto Him and make abode with him but if

the Catholics added it that and all was

plan of Yahweh because no one touch the

scripture here on this yahwah commenced

him

I'm already before I used to say no what

a wicked person no one touches Yahweh

scripture only

Yahweh commands him to touch it and if

they touch it and change it for what

reason do they do so that they do not

understand the truth that is all that

they do not understand the truth why did

Yahweh change the text or cause the text

to be changed of baptized in the name of

the Father the Son Holy Spirit don't

think that yahwah got upset when they

added that if yahoo would have been i've

said the one that was about to add that

he would have smoked him i mean if if

elijah

if elijah had the capacity of

incinerating fifty soldiers at one time

does y'all would not have the capacity

of incinerating whoever's about to add

that obviously it's obvious so then why

does y'all way allow i don't even like

that word but rather he designed and

placed that text there why didn't place

that text there why so that they don't

get back to us in his name no listen to

what I'm saying

why did Yahweh cause the dragon to write

that text there why for what reason that

they do not get baptized in his name

only some have the privilege of getting

baptized in the name of Yeshua and the

rest forget it and why did he write all

these texts that are changed to know for

what reason that they worship the Father

the Son Holy Spirit but not him because

someone worships him if someone listen

to what I'm about to say if someone

according to what is written identifies

Yeshua HaMashiach as Yahweh if someone

understands that yahwah came in that

when yahwah left the solely spirit that

raha Kadesh is Yahweh himself yahwah has

another option than to save that person

because that's what he says look unto me

and be saved

Christianity looks unto Yeshua and are

saved but Yeshua is not Yahweh you see

Jesus is not identified by them as

Yahweh they identify him as the son of

God the Son of God

you always said look unto me and be ye

saved that the whole world not look unto

him be saved he left and designed all

type of Scripture here but

those whom he wants to understand the

truth will understand it that is very

clear are you understanding this it is

not by chance that you're listening to

this he wants you to understand the

truth and if you're there and understand

this don't you worry don't you worry

because even if you force yourself to

understand you understand it even if you

put all your efforts into it you won't

understand it so then I don't want the

spirit of Yeshua's father I want the

spirit of the Father my father my

husband yah was about the only one I

don't want anyone elses there's only one

spirit there is only one Elohim there's

only one Yahweh which is the one I want

no one else I don't care about his

family because why don't I care because

he left it very clear he said you will

not know anyone any other Elohim outside

of me I can read through on times why am

I so hard with the father of Yahweh why

because gave me a command you shall not

know another Elohim except for me

so then yahwah cannot tell me that in so

many texts and then later say recognize

my father no no he in fact since he knew

what was gonna happen and since he

designed what was gonna happen to his

children he said I am the only one only

I

I am your Elohim I am your Saviour in my

name you will have salvation

Shema Israel listen Israel not the whole

world

yahwah lo hey no Yahweh your Elohim and

ours yahwah is only one if later on you

find out he's our father mother son

sister mary or a trinity all of you

israel focus and that i'm only one i am

and when i die for israel I will come

back unto you in a spiritual way and

those who believe all of that will be my

bride that is what yahwah is saying did

you get text 23 did we do away with the

doubts of we will come into him can the

spirit of the father of yeshua coming to

us know if the spirit of the father

sure comes I'll reject him I'll reject

him I want and do with him if another

guy comes along says I am another one

the Holy Spirit you can go and wait the

questions exactly go with the Christians

not here

that's why yellow says do you want to be

protected from all this you want to be

protected right on your houses door sham

as well yeah well okay no yeah we had

right it repeat it so then whoever that

comes along and says that it's written

here you can go in join the Christians

are you understanding the importance of

this study why to write it on the

doorposts for it does not allow do you

know what the Jew say in fact when they

repeat it before they go to bed it is

per se a protection that no entity or

demon can come and attack you because

you've just declared that you have an

Elohim who's Joey that's it's over no

one can if you belong to Yahweh who can

attack you no one can attack you so then

actually that is the heart of this study

which will continue because I've got to

correct many things what do I have to

correct things in at this same levels

what I'm talking about at the same level

speaking about this same level on this

same understanding farewell then 24 he

that loveth me not you sure already said

that he that loveth me obviously he will

come and abide with us but in your

Bibles did you correct that text 23 or

since you understand - aha you already

corrected in your mind ok he that loveth

me not what'd he say first he that loved

me what what does he do he keeps he

keeps the commandments the commandments

the myths fought any gift or word which

is what he's saying he that loveth me

not keepeth not my words there it is

very clear he that loveth me not keeping

not my words in the word which she hear

is not mine but the father switch sent

me that word which we have heard is not

his what word is he talking about

the Torah you should say I didn't write

the trial yah we did that's what he's

saying

it is a parable the because you show

which is the human

that they're seeing there he didn't

write who was the one who wrote Yahweh

that is why that father he's speaking in

parables I read again he that loveth me

not keepeth not my Saints first tells

you that the words are his right in the

word what she hear is not mine but the

father switch sent me that father who

had sent him is the father Yahweh who

got into a human body he was sent in a

human body and he's not speaking if if

you didn't understand this text and you

haven't understood anything that I've

been speaking about and that word is

thought wrong 25 was that understood or

not if you find it to be a bit

far-fetched the evidence said this at

all this is the key to understand at all

these things have I spoken unto you

being yet present with you but the

comforter the Holy Ghost or the raka

Kadesh which actually should be called

the spirit of holiness not Holy Spirit

rah ha kodesh does not mean Holy Spirit

it is the spirit of holiness which is

different because when one says the Holy

Spirit it would appear to be a person

the spirit of holiness is something else

I want to define that that was never the

Holy Spirit it was the spirit of

holiness in the spirit of holiness the

raha Kadesh is a spirit of Elohim but

the comforter the spirit of holiness

whom the father will send in my name he

shall teach you all things and bring all

things to your remembrance whatsoever I

have said unto you and this here is

really fulfilled through all the history

of the eternal truth why do I want to

say that because the spirit of holiness

is the one that speaks through the

prophets and look at what it says but

the comforter the ruach ha'qodesh

whom the father which is Yahweh not the

father forget about the father the

father has nothing to do anything here

and ever and anything to do in the Tri

nor does he have anything to do with us

here whom Yahweh will send in my name

for Yahweh sent him in the name of

Yeshua that we understand that Yeshua is

Yahweh he he albeit a prophet albeit

whomever that uses the spread of

holiness he shall teach you

Oh things wait a minute why did you

should say that if all things have

already been written here in Scripture

it's all written why is it gonna send

the spirit of holiness are you following

this if everything's already written

he's already sent it nope nope because

here it says he shall teach you all

things and bring all things to your

remembrance whatsoever I have said unto

you

today we remembered what he has said and

not just what he said but what he meant

to say did we remember what he said or

not okay then it's not talking about

writing Scripture nor reading scripture

it's talking about understanding

scripture did you understand that or not

the comforter is the spirit of Yahweh

who speaks through the prophets which

comforts your hearts who lives in us if

he wants to who makes us do things that

he wants us to do that is the spirit of

holiness I don't want to say Holy Spirit

because that is a bad translation dry ha

kodesh Rua is spirit the Ruach ha is of

or the Kadesh is holiness so then it is

the spirit the Holy One you cannot

translate the spirit the Holy One it is

the spirit of holiness that is the

correct translation farewell then

southern what does this mean it means

that that which is written the spirit of

holiness will make us understand he will

teach us how many things does it say all

things and also make us remember

everything which I have told you but in

the real sense of what I said not of the

parables because in order if you don't

have the spirit of holiness then the

parable you understand it as another and

everything that you should understand

peace I leave with you

Shalom I give you I give it unto you not

as the world giveth let not your heart

be troubled neither let it be afraid ye

have heard how I said unto you I go away

and come again unto you

if you loved me ye would rejoice what is

you should say if he loved me do you

know what that if he loved me means it

was found in the Shema love Yahweh your

Elohim with all your heart with all your

mind that's what he's saying if he only

understood that I am Yahweh that's what

he means by if he loved me because he's

just not saying love me and also love

Yahweh because the commandment says love

Yahweh not Yeshua love Yahweh southern

Yeshua says if you loved me if you

understood that I am Yahweh and you left

me with all your heart with all your

mind with all your strength if you loved

me ye would rejoice the problem is that

they was the problem they didn't

understand whom he was that's why it

says if he loved me if you understood

that I am Yahweh you would have rejoiced

because I said I go unto the Father for

the father greater is then I okay right

there in what I believe right there he

is talking about his father but there he

is talking about his father because

right there he's not saying that his

father's coming

there's father's come in relation with

us it's as if you loved me you would

understand that I am Yahweh your father

and you would be happy and joyful

because I've said that I'd gone to the

Father for the father greater is then I

in other words what y'all was saying

here for whomever will understand is

that if we if they had understood that

that was Yahweh it would have solved all

their problems cuz I was Yahweh speaking

and when he said I'm off to my father's

house where there are many mansions when

he said to my father's house I'm going

he's talking about his father it's not

talking about the father of Israel but

his father we've got a understand father

Ezra his father there are two fathers

here how many fathers are there here if

he owes his my father my father my

father I can say my father who are they

talking about the one who died and my

father Yahweh who am I talking about do

you see so then no close your minds that

one's his father he's only talking about

his father no

sometimes he says most of time sees his

father as he the father of Israel his

father father of Israel his father aids

Oh as well you see Mooney says your

father winces your sense of your father

what father we've got to understand when

he's his father you gotta understand

what he's talking about whether it's

your shoe or whether it's the father of

you sure or a Giselle that is clear

right very well

so then or even Abraham didn't they say

we're children of Abraham we are

children of Abraham Abraham is her

father they say how many fathers have

they a whole bunch of fathers the things

to find out whom he is referring to

where Wheldon so then when Yeshua said

I'm going to the house of my father that

father that father is his father because

he's going to his father's house here

he's saying my father is greater than I

and that's perfectly fine the father is

greater than him there's no turn of the

page the father is greater than him why

is he greater because his father and

does anybody doubt that but even if he's

greater than him does that make me

worship Him no because he gave me a

command worship only Yahweh your Creator

so then the father who's greater than he

is not my Creator

who's my Creator Yahweh yahwah's my

Creator he the son of his father Yahweh

the son of his father is what I'm

teaching Burke here because maybe some

of you just don't understand this very

clear because I like to teach things

clearly if not you sure taught in

parables but now he sent me to teach

clearly because if I teach him parables

would being the same thing

yuxuan parables are in parables no one

understands a thing why if you have to

parent his bride of course well why did

you show up they say if you're gonna

continue on with a purple why did you

come verbal then so then it says Yahweh

declares that his father is greater than

him and that's perfect he's greater than

him obviously not a resolver his mother

did mentor her because he heard it son

better sheep so then and he never

revealed the way she was or anything

very well then 29 and now I have told

you before it come to pass that when it

is come to pass you might believe who's

the only one that speaks that way it's

yeah do you know why he said that

because he's the only one the only being

that speaks that way he says I'll tell

you from before so that when it happened

you believe the same thing he said in

isaiah 45:21 I'll read it to you

Jerusalem 2001 isaiah 45:21 i've already

read it by will again declare and

present your case let them take counsel

together who hath declared this from

ancient time since better sheet and

announced that some time ago I have not

a Yahweh so then who's the one that

announces things before they happen

yow it does and there's not another

Elohim outside of me it is very clear it

is very clear how many Elohim are there

no one else there is now they're looking

beside me I just tell him and Savior who

is the just Elohim savior of Israel

Yahweh so then when you show him and

he's the safer than who's that

it is Yahweh obviously we don't have to

saviors mind you Savior one Savior two

then savior three then a whole country

called el salvador no wait a minute

hold on a minute here there's only one

Savior whose name is Yahweh Yahweh so

then says there is no Elohim beside me I

just tell him and Savior there is none

beside me Sullivan you sure says and now

I have told you before it come to pass

who speaks like that Yahweh only Yahweh

that when it come to pass he might

believe believe what that I am Yahweh

are you understanding to believe what

that what I said was true

now who cares about that if it was

fulfilled it was fulfilled what is it

that we have to believe what is it look

I'll read it again so that you see what

one thinks that it says in the text does

not say and now I have told you before

it come to pass that when it is come to

pass ye might believe the question is if

somebody tells me and someone tells me

look that house is gonna be burnt

tomorrow and I believe him or not I

could care less the next day it burns

down to the ground so then what is it

that I have to believe that what he said

was true I already saw it burnt to the

ground

it's already been discarded it already

happened what I have to believe but the

one who told me that prophesy is Yahweh

are you understanding I mean just an

example I'm giving you an example so

then yahwah says and now i have told you

before it come to pass that when it come

to pass you might believe that has

already happened it does

matter whether we believe that it will

happen it already happened but what is

that we have to believe that the one who

were speaking and the one that was there

the one who was there his name is Yahweh

Elohim that is what we are you

understanding this concept very well

then hereafter I will not talk much with

you I've already told you enough he says

I will not talk much with you for the

prince of this world cometh and hath

nothing in me now part of I've had the

nothing in me I mean the Christians oh

man

the Christians say because Jesus didn't

sin so then Asia or the devil the devil

Satan had nothing on him that is what

the Christians say that is what Ellen

White says that since he had not sinned

the devil could have come and impute

anything on him are you following very

well them but that's not what the text

says the text doesn't say that the

original text says because the prince of

this world cometh and he hath no power

over me oh it changes right he has no

power over me but of course if they

translate it the way they have to

translate what happens the temptation of

you sure would already seem to be stupid

if he has no power over him do you see

one starts to say yeah already that

cannot be we've already seen it it's

extremely stupid but the Christians need

these type of texts let's read from the

Jerusalem Bible who deemed well to

translate it better

Jerusalem 2001 says it will no longer

many things with you for the prince of

this world derive it in that prince of

this world he must have said it so

ironically because he's no more than a

damn beast a pet if you will he's not

the Prince the only king of this world

is human beings but that Prince like if

humans are the king he was the Prince

what does that mean that he was a pet

that he was a pair of the human being

but he must have said it with lots of uh

I wish I would have heard that tone of

voice he used here comes the Prince like

that the Prince of this world but the

Christians say the Prince the master no

no you shouldn't say like that you

should fear onic the prince of this

world cometh and me he has no power how

much power does that pet

have in Yahweh zero zero power zero

absolutely zero before you used to

believe that he was talking about how

that pet can find a speck on him is that

what you believed that's what the church

said you do know what I'm talking about

right

they always explain that text since

yahwah didn't know they don't say Yahweh

no for the Adventist Church yeah we

didn't come since Jesus did not sin then

the accuser cannot accuse him he's

nothing on me he wanted to say he sent

but couldn't say that that has nothing

to with the fact all he says he has no

power over me obviously 31 but that the

world may know that I love the father

and as the father gave me commandment

even so I do arise let us go hence here

I believe that he's talking about his

father I believe that because he loves

her father and his demonstrated that he

loves his father what son does not love

his father and if on top of that his

father's will him imperfect they must

have a perfect love between them I

accept that and I desire to love his

father as well but for now I have not

the authority of loving his father but

just to respect them do you understand

to understand that he exists but that

his son is my Elohim southern here it

says but that the world may know that I

love the father and the world has

already known that we the world knows at

least we do we know that he's got a

father and as the father gave me

commandment even so I do arise let us go

hence we could also understand that when

you shook him to the world before having

him as a son before you show we're even

born before yahoo were even born I want

to go back before Yahweh were even born

of course his father must have had a

plan for him until ugh well the plan was

for her son to live forever happy why do

you have a son for friend to live

happily ever after but he was not the

slave of the father because we may get

to thinking that Yahweh had a son to

make him die I even said that once since

Yahweh could that I said that in 2011

since Yahweh could not come to diet

weight not Yahweh since God

I said I'll said the way they said it

and why did I say that because of Paul

because is that that God is in

inaccessible light and

blah-blah-blah-blah-blah

since at that time I was Pauline and all

the messages power my nature I had to

make a decision what was the definition

the definition was maybe don't remember

I'd find it since God the Father could

not die for he has no beginning he had

to have a son who had a beginning so

that he could die that was my definition

at that time with Paul with Ellen and

all the rest that definition is perfect

because that's the little book that

Yahweh had me eat when he said eat this

book he gave me Paul he gave me Ellen

and what did you expect

it was y'all was plan I clearly see it

that way and then it became bitter in my

stomach

obviously he gave me garbage to eat if I

were to give you garbage to eat and it

embitters your entrails obviously

obviously but just like he had me eat it

we took it to the toilet he had as he

Paul Ellen and all the other garbage we

ate it it was sweet

it gave us a stomachache and then it

went directly to the latrine as useless

as directed to the latrine so then that

is what I had defined that could never

be that way that definition was Pauline

it was from Ellen G white along with

what I understood of the two that could

never be that way

Yahweh is not the son of the father

because the father could not come and

die for the world because the creation

is not of the Father but of the son of

the son that son is Yahweh so then the

relation between he and his father is

very mysterious but one thing I can tell

you it is of love it is of perfection so

then that is what is precisely written

and he says that the world won't may

know that he loves his father as

perfectly as his father and the father

sent me that's perfect a plan

that maybe even the two traced is

convenient maybe the son said dad would

I do I'm alone I want to get married are

you gonna have another daughter are you

gonna have another daughter that I can

get married maybe the father said no

make your own world and make your own

bride so then is there okay and maybe

the father even helped him design it not

the rest but he created do you follow so

then that entire plan which he made up

traced along with his father either way

he is our only Elohim Yeshua HaMashiach

Yahweh is about there is no one else

outside of him

Shema Israel Yahweh Elohim knew Yahweh

Ahad I'm gonna wrap this up with this

from now on you have to repeat it

fluidly in Hebrew in Spanish in English

if you're an English speaker as well say

when you get up in the morning say when

you go to bed at night say it all the

time

write little signs write little signs

put them up on your door posts on your

car instead of putting them up a picture

I don't know of your soccer team or

whatever instead of the logo of your

soccer team put up the picture of the

Shema which is way too important that is

the protection against any false

doctrine or whatever misunderstood

parable right instead of the flag of

your country hanging there

the Mexican won or whatever a

tri-colored one which is an absolute

copy of Italy they want it to be Italian

and they use the tri-colored one exactly

Roman to the Meryem in Mexico that flag

was copied from Italy I've told you a

thousand times

it is a Mickey Mouse flag a bad copy of

Italy which means is that they are

Romans to the marrow you may like those

colors a lot

it is Italy in there a copy I'm not

trying to offend anybody it's so that

you learn because if you don't

understand that your Israelites you

should be laughing about your freaking

countries I mean for real take out that

master in fact if you want to have love

for your country go ahead from that

country you'll never advance that's

where you stay but those of us who hate

these countries with all our heart and

with all our soul and we love Yahweh

with all our heart our soul and our

strength those are the ones going to

heaven the rest couldn't stay in Mexico

Argentina Spain El Salvador where we

like if you're proud of that go there

Colombia as well

wherever country you may choose

Nicaragua what's the other one I missed

on Brazil yeah we got to mention them

Brazil - the greatest country in the

world ok if you like Brazil stay in

Brazil but we're gonna go a little

higher than Brazil a little bit higher

than a little bit higher than the dome

so then that is all the central message

Yahweh is one alone Yahweh had that is

why the bride of you is short 22 is

called yahwah Ahad no one can be the

bride of yeshua and then there might

they be thinking that they have two

husbands that she gets dual penetration

that is the father and the son and no no

the bride of you sure understands us

clearly she marries one alone and that's

the only one that can possess her and

that is the only one that can play with

her comfort her imagine if I want to

marry a girl and since I'm not there I

sent a friend to comfort her imagine

that and then the friend and a husband

come together to comfort her none of

that is the truth leave that for

Christianity leave that for Judaism but

those guys are not gonna ascend not even

a meter from this earth the bride of

Yeshua is the only one that goes to

heaven for a thousand years and she has

to clearly know who her husband is that

her husband does not send another that

her husband does not come accompanied

with his father that her husband is one

alone always was since he got us out of

Egypt since Adan and up until today he's

one alone we shall meet again in the

bride of Yeshua 23 let us conclude with

a word of Prayer as you are

blessed art thou yah was about thou art

our only Elohim and Elohim who took us

out of Egypt an Elohim that makes us see

the truth you are our Father and also

are our Savior and also are our husband

blessed art thou Yeshua HaMashiach

all this Lord that we have clearly seen

that when you speak you speak in

parables but the absolute truth is also

found in your words thou art Yeshua

HaMashiach yah was about thou art our

only eloheem and thou art our husband in

that precious name of Yeshua HaMashiach

do we pray in may the Lord bless you and

keep you remember that to understand

this is actually to understand the

eternal truth if the Lord allows it we

shall meet again next Shabbat many

blessings to every one of youth
