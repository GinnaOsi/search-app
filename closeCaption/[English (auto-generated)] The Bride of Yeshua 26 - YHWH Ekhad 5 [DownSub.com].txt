shabbat shalom limits of eternal truth

and French listening um this sub

precious and heated day of Shabbat from

California we shall study yet another

chapter of the bride of Yeshua chapter

26 Yahweh HUD number 5 part 5 and as

I've already told you will have many

more parts because there's lots to Rhys

teddy

review and understand certain texts

today's Shabbat the 30th of Sivan we

thought this month would have 29 days of

Sivan and we thought that we would

already be today Shabbat on the first

day of the fourth month but the moon did

not show up anywhere we as part of the

group lineage of the eternal truth node

and saw it from here from California no

one saw it from Mexico not from the west

coast of the American continent known

saw it that was a part where it could

have been seen it was very difficult to

see no one saw it and there's also no

reports in the world because there are

many groups that look for the moon for

different reasons

there were no reports of it ever been

seen many reported that they didn't see

it they didn't see it from El Salvador

either so then there was actually no

report whatsoever of the moon ever been

seen the moon did not show up so then

these are motives which are more than

enough and concrete enough so as to not

declare the new month today we will see

absolutely sure that everyone will be

able to take pictures this time so then

we're living on the last day of the

month of Sivan 30 days and today at

sunset Shabbat at sunset well the fourth

month begins so then obviously there's

no need for pictures because it's

already third

days but the pictures are very much

welcome all the pictures of the moon I'm

saying it's not necessary because

there's no month in the calendar that

has more than 30 days but we actually

enjoy and it delights us to see pictures

of the moon on the first day when it

shows up in the sky as a great clock of

Yahweh the other point was that it is

not so important this month the fourth

month is not so important what's

interesting that there is no feasts know

anything so doesn't affect anything nor

does it affect the following month

because the calendar we had which we had

published we had written that it had

that the fourth month had 30 days but

it'll have 29 so then the following

month which is the month of the fifth

month of the month love you surprised me

that you kind of know the names already

the month of of the month will begin

within the time that's written in the

calendar either way we have to see the

moment because it is on the 29th day but

it is more probably that'll be that way

so the rest of the calendar is not

affected whatsoever so then you're gonna

have to wait for me a little bit more

with the calendar because we have to

publish it again

so then today the 30th of Sivan last

month of Sivan of the year five thousand

nine hundred eighty seven we're 12 years

away to get to the six thousand twelve

years could be a lot of time it could

not be much time it could be the way we

believe that it will be which I

personally believe that Yahweh will

enter into Shabbat before he gets the

time but either way the limit time is

twelve years in some months to complete

the six thousand years this corresponds

to the 14th of July of the year 2018 in

the Gregorian Roman Christian Catholic

pagan calendar that is the year we're

living the 14th of July of the year 2018

as you

let us seek our elohim beloved yahweh

that art in heaven thank you Lord we

give thee for you give us life health

and because we can worship you on this

day I ask Lord that your blessing be for

every one of your children today on this

Shabbat and that you actually speak to

us through Scripture I ask you that your

spirit a company is on a permanent basis

and that it prepare us for your soon

return all this I ask you in the

precious name with which you came to

this earth Yeshua HaMashiach yahweh has

blessed with another year of life the

following members of the eternal truth

hey soos of el rios argentina al

bailey's janice bell mendoza buys the

dominican republic Araceli Calderon

Aguilar Mexico Donnell William Bernal

the US of A a very Anna Salas Dominguez

Mexico every Sabbath James

Panama for every one of you may the Lord

bless you keep you and may you receive

all the blessings from heaven and we are

joyful that Yahweh has granted you to

live another year of life on this earth

on earth in which it is difficult to

live in it is rather difficult to live

on this earth to survive and to survive

kind of this week I saw a video it was a

father and two sons who pulled over to

buy something this was in Mexico a guy

came and killed all three and took off

with the wallet life isn't worth

anything anymore whatever little thing

that is working well today can fail

tonight and you can die just whatever

little virus

small little paper cut and you're a

goner it's over

so then what really keeps us alive I

think it's only by yahwah's mercy

nothing else because we are rather

vulnerable to whatever

any little thing steny imperfection that

we may have in our system there has a

whole lot of functions that we couldn't

sit here and list them all the sudden

something fails another function wants

to compensate for it and that function

itself kills you and that said it's over

and there's no turning back and actually

we must think that we're alive we must

thank for being able to in a day of rest

like this Shabbat to study the word of

Yahweh and most importantly to

comprehend what the word says proverbs

25:2 it is the glory of Elohim to

conceal the word yet it is the honor of

the king to search out the word so then

all those who get to discover and

understand the meaning of the word the

word itself tells you that that person

is a king because the rest of the

servants of this earth never achieved to

understand what the word says it is all

concealed it is all in code it is all a

big parable and the secret that only the

Kings can get to understand is what's so

marvelous about comprehending what the

word actually says for example in dumb

news I call him dumb bethere rather

stupid dumb news this week I was

surprised by one that says that Israel

plans to get to the moon in 2019 did you

read it it says that as it turns out we

shall plant the Israeli flag in the moon

but it won't be an Israelite but an

Israeli robot

how did they deceive a sir then you see

how it's all a big great conspiracy

because if Russia's been to space if

China got there if the u.s. got there

because they said they planted their own

flag there the u.s. is the only one that

has supposedly placed a man on the moon

the rest had gotten there but only I

have sent the spatial little corps a

robot Northwest they're all liars

so then when one stops to think about

what Babylon is you see that it is a

generalized lie so then all the problems

that are in the world of wars and all

the rest it is just a distraction

because if if Israel knows if China

knows Russia knows if the u.s. knows

that they cannot go to the moon then and

they all cover each other's backs if

they all know that the satellites do not

exist oh they can have is a static

balloon somewhere but the rest of the

satellites as they say that they exist

they don't exist and precisely their

satellites are the elite satanic the

word says it so then you see how amongst

themselves all the fights frictions and

even Wars are for different things but

amongst themselves they're all United

they're all together because it is a lie

a great great great lies so then so then

these little brothers were Terrace

Israelites they say they're gonna get to

the bone in 2019 that's within the

official news mind you now the non

official news is that Cyrus as they call

Trump Cyrus did you see how they just

issued out an official coin in Israel an

official coin with the face of Cyrus the

face of Trump and the temple I would

have liked to have one but an original

one is already a thousand dollars I

looked for it and a thousand dollars for

the original one their copies are all

but why would I want to copy the

original ones you can still get a mini

Bey but they're between eight hundred

and a thousand dollars for each coin

with the phase of cyrus the face of

Trump and the

and it's a 70 years of celebration and

they put Trump there because he did the

same thing that Cyrus did they compared

him with Cyrus because Trump gave the

order

so that Jerusalem would be the capital

of Israel worldwide sire is the same

thing he gave the order

so that Jerusalem would be rebuilt so

then the next thing that that the

Christians say mind you the thing that

Cyrus will do is to give the order to

build the temple and they say that it's

all that it is all planned already so

that that temple be rebuilt in the year

2019 and I'm giving you those news that

one says might they be true I mean I'm

just telling you the knees that are

going around

that's why Cyrus went on this whole tour

fixing the differences he went with the

Arabs

he went throughout many countries now

the European Union

he went to go see the Queen of England

taking care of all the dis courts the

problems supposed to have everything

prepared so that Israel build the temple

starting from 2019 they're like close to

the end of the year of 2019 Israel will

start to build the temple backed up by

Cyrus that would be interesting I'm

telling it to you as news very very

interesting

now there's another article now this is

not speculative this is more than

interesting two weeks from now on the

27th of June Friday 27th of June so then

net this upcoming Friday but the

following Friday at sunset sorry

schibetta not Friday but in the

Gregorian calendar I have to say that it

is Friday because up until midnight is

still Friday according to Catholics so

then this Friday which is actually a

Shabbat and it is not by chance that it

is on 2-bay of which is the fifteenth of

odd for them not for us will be barely

in the

fourth month there already an EV but for

them in their calendar it'll be too bad

the 15th of of the day of love

it'll be produced over Israel and over

Europe Africa and Asia the lunar eclipse

or Blood Moon the greater stars been in

the 21st century never again will there

be another Eclipse as big as that one I

know that we a little more wording sick

of seeing eclipses here I had never seen

him in my life but all the sudden I saw

five eclipses with a red moon just like

these beautiful roses brought by Danilo

here thank you for the flowers Danilo

blood-red the moon it's almost common

for us or not we had never seen it

before we had read it in Scripture then

we started to see it take pictures for

now Blood Moon now it be surprised if I

saw one I don't know a color I don't

know I'm a yellowish pinkish color or

something like that like a

phosphorescent green I'd be like wow

I've never seen it but the blood moons

I'm already bored of them per say with

the rainbow colors right a moon that

would come with the rainbow colors which

they assert for their gay flag that

would be interesting to see

nice little moon like that I mean that

would be interesting but I mean a Blood

Moon already for us it's like something

that happens very often in this country

or as of late and we no longer see those

are something marvelous because lilica

yeah I'm already bored of seeing them

I'm not really bored I'm just saying

that as a parable so you understand what

I'm saying but in Israel for their

calendar too bad it'll be produced in

Shabbat that moon the greatest Blood

Moon we've ever seen an hour and a half

of the eclipse the moon will be the

closest to us than ever and Mars the red

planet the closest if you know look in

the sky and you see

something weird you've never seen its

marce it's like a red star if you don't

do a double-take you think it's a plane

it's not a plane it's Mars you see it

very red very clear and you can go and

see it tonight if you haven't seen it so

then during that Eclipse on that Shabbat

on that Eclipse over Israel the moon

will be seen completely red over an hour

and a half Mars will be in the closest

point to earth on that day all that is

produced on Shabbat and on to pay off in

their calendar I find that rather

impressive a sign of destruction the

moon's the moon's are signs red moons

are signs of destruction destruction

over Israel not over the world that's

what I give or take understand total

eclipses of the Sun are total

destruction over the world but lunar

blood eclipse moons are concerning

Israel only and it turns out this one

will be produced over that land aserp by

babylon do you see how Israel is Babylon

now they say they're gonna get to the

moon who are they then bunch of liars

absolute liars ok then so then we'll pay

attention to that Eclipse we do not know

when the Great Tribulation will begin we

don't know if the Great Tribulation has

already begun

we do not know that how will we know

we'll have to see in time if we're not

in the Great Tribulation

but no more disasters are gonna be

presented like this kilauea 1 everything

will be left to nought and there's no

way to stop Kilauea 300 to 500

earthquakes take place there per day

it's getting worse by the minute and

scientists say that it will not stop it

won't stop it'll continue on and on but

even if that continues that doesn't mean

that the Great Tribulation has begun

just because the Kilauea is shooting out

lava that doesn't mean that but if other

things appear then we know that we're in

that period

or we're not not period and we have to

wait for more time I'm gonna answer a

question that many people have asked me

you know one answered publicly I

answered some privately but I'd like to

answer it publicly because many people

probably didn't ask the question thus

they were surprised what I said last

Shabbat they hadn't asked and now they

had that doubt last shebat I was not

advising to eat meat I said that it was

not a sin to eat meat to eat clean meats

and that everyone has to be a judge of

what he eats if you don't eat meat it's

not a sin if you eat clean meat it is

not a sin I can compare this before we

can didn't talk about me compare it with

the marriage of one men with many women

two three four women according to the

Torah it is not a sin according to

Babylon slaw it is a sin or it is

illegal they don't call it a sin but

they call it illegal

so then illegal and it's got a penalty

if one tries to do that legally you

can't get married they don't tell you

anything if you live together but if you

legally want to get married you'd be in

an illegal situation can go to jail

southern is there a sin for a man to

marry two women not for the Torah but

for Babylon it is so then if you were to

ask me there's the dilemma

there's the dilemma if I say that it is

not a sin then I'm going against the

laws of where we live if I say it is a

sin I'm directly going against the

trough because Yahweh says for me not to

add to a truck do not add anything now

take away southern is it convenient to

marry two women well I could answer that

it is not convenient it's not convenient

you advise that no I don't advise that

but it doesn't matter what I advise or

not every one of you must be a judge of

what you read and are the Torah

authorizes you

Babylon says that it's illegal is it

convenient to you if you were to ask me

obviously it is not convenient to marry

many women we're in a different time in

a different society it's not convenient

now Babylon authorizes two men to get

married legally the trust is that that's

an abominable sin so you see that's the

way it is the Torah tells you that it is

a sin not just any sin but an abominable

one Babylon says that it is legal you

can do it and even encourages you to

that is when we have to save the process

it's a sin you don't do it if the

process as it is not a sin then I will

evaluate whether I do it or not do you

see same thing with the meat do we need

meat no not if you have a balanced diet

with everything you need you don't need

me but for those people that cannot get

everything then they can consume meat in

their judgment if all they get is rice

and one bean they know they'll have is

rice and forget about the beans rice and

corn nothing but rice and corn for two

years and you can't get anything else

but you can get clean meats then I would

say that it is convenient for you to

clean meats along with that rice and

corn that you have do you understand

what I'm saying but then a person that

has everything at his disposal

let him be is on judge let him be is on

judge but the question is this weren't

we not supposed to eat blood and a meat

that can be found in Babylon has not

been drained of all the blood that's the

question that hull enters just to get to

this question I said our oven door or in

some previous studies that the meat that

we that Babylon offers that we could get

which is offered by Babylon that it is a

sin to eat it because as blood and that

only kosher meat in other

approved by the Israelites which has

been drained according to them to the

maximum point of draining that's the

only one that we could get well as many

people asked me a question I started to

investigate a bit and I concluded the

following when the trust is that you

should not eat meat with its blood what

it's saying is that the animal has to be

well bled now the level of the bleeding

is not specified in the trout let's

start there first point it doesn't say

bleed it to the last drop two hours

hanging from its hind legs and once you

shake it and not another drop comes up

it is ready the truck doesn't say that

doesn't say that what the trust says is

for you not to kill an animal and then

directly after killing it you start

grilling it with the trough says in this

aspect is that an animal that died on

its own that it died on you or it was

attacked by an animal and he killed it

and for him to say oh the animal has

just died I'm gonna go ahead and eat it

no because it died and it wasn't blood

now I didn't know this because accidents

don't care about the subject I'm

presenting it because it isn't that raw

I don't care about talking about me I

couldn't care less about it

it's those topics I could care less

about but legally Yahweh gave us a law

and that law even if I could care less

about it I have to teach it parts of the

law that I couldn't care less about I

have to teach him so then I started to

study the techniques of bleeding of

animals and I read some books and I

found things I didn't know for example

do you know why every meat has to be

bled because if it is not bled the

health standards I didn't know this my

truth the health standards through

investigations they discovered that the

meat rots extremely quick if you don't

bleed it so then it is convenient for

but in the world to bleed it always

because if they don't bleed it they

cannot preserve it in a good state the

more blood a piece of meat is the

tougher when the meat is not bled it

rots quickly even if you freeze it

blood you have to immediately calculate

it and make blood sausage that people

like southern every meat that you buy

has been bled by law and by necessity by

law because that's the way it's been

established in the slaughterhouse for

them to be bled and out of necessity

because because as it turns out I don't

think any meat producer would want for

his meat to go bad quickly so then the

level of the bleeding it is not

considered in the trough not to eat meat

I mean blood that is contempt by the

trough now when you cut the meat you see

how when you cut the meat and you see

that little red juice that comes out

kind of red that is not blood I didn't

know this I also don't care but I had to

start reading books about the legality

about killing an animal and how they

bleed it that that red stuff you see in

a piece of meat when you cut it and it

looks red it is not blood I thought it

was blood you thought it was blood it's

not blood it is protein that begins to

dissolve protein that starts to dissolve

that's where the media is read if that

were really blood once you bleed the

animal how should the meat look white

like chicken white but the meat is red

the proper color of the fibers are red

and those juices are protein it is not

blood if that were blood that would be

rotten so no matter if you see that lik

will come out that is not blood if you

look at a steak from the Jews I've never

tried it but if you were to look at

pictures of kosher meat you'll also see

that red juice for it is the the fibers

that are breaking down and dissolving

Ferelden that's all I want to say about

that so then if you decide

and I care less about the motives if you

decide that you need meat in your diet

and you eat it then the meat you buy has

been bled enough to be legal with the

Torah is that clear

now McDonald's meat and all the rest I

don't even know what type of meat that

is or if that's even meat I don't know

that's also I don't care in the very

least about well just like with the

chicken and all the hormones and staff

exactly you will decide if you want

hormones in your system and all the rest

all that stuff hormones antibiotics and

all the rest you decide that but but

maybe maybe you have a friend who was a

farm and you can buy well fed chicken

that's I'm saying you have to decide

okay you're the one that's gonna have to

decide time for a question Chris

yes about life now bean is who you are

Israelite Nami is there an objection or

something against eating lamb lamb goat

beef those big animals

it is completely legal by the Torah that

taraj does not favor one of the three as

if to say eat lamb if you don't have

land and eat goat if you don't have goat

they need beef no those three groups at

least of animals are the same now if any

one of you decides to eat any of those

animals you can legally do so according

to the trough now your question I

believe is going towards why I said we

should not eat goat or lamb during PASOK

right why would you have that question

there right if we're talking about

salvation it resembles the Lamb of God

exactly no no no if you're gonna eat it

as a symbol jump a sock out say it's

wrong

I'll take thats wrong it is better that

if you have decided to eat that because

you need it eat it some other day but

don't make lamb for Pesach because the

lamb of PASOK has already come has died

directed and loved so then if I make

lamb and eat it then I am symbolizing

that I am still waiting for the lamb I'm

saying he hasn't showed up yet because

that's what it symbolizes saying we must

eat that lamb we have to kill the lamb

we have to kill it because if you want

to say the things as the Torah says we

have to kill the lamb ourselves we can't

just go by a leg of lamb you can't get

some lamb chops and say I'm celebrating

Pesach no no no pear stock would be

celebrated with an entire lamb and that

lamb would be divided among families

entirely you had to consume it entirely

during PASOK you cannot go to the meat

market and say can I have a leg lamb and

with that I'll celebrate Pesach that'd

be an abomination the law said they had

to choose a lamb on the 10th

put it away sacrifice it in the 14th and

if your family was pretty large to eat

it entirely alls get together with

another family and eat it entirely and

whatever was left over to burn it

afterward that's how you would celebrate

so don't even think about it as a member

of the eternal truth don't even let it

remotely come to mind to celebrate with

the lamb next passage because such a lot

does not exist and if you do it I

consider it to be an abomination because

our lamb has already come it's already

lost its meaning that's why we ate fish

we could eat something else that has

nothing to do with that do you follow

verbal them did I answer your question

perfectly well and if you won eight lamb

because you need it every day that right

there would be the same as to eat

another is the same as if to eat another

type of meat I mean just be careful

because I'm not saying that it will do

you any good meat is filled with all

kinds of stuff that's if you need it

that's if you need it replaces red meat

to a certain measure yes but not all the

way only to a certain measure but not in

everything there are things that fish

does not have that red meat does so

right now it's because we need all the B

complex and stir exactly fish helps a

lot for those who one ate it helps a lot

but your diet can't to be based just on

fish that would use it as a compliment

for me the vegetable kingdom is

marvelous

but when we don't have at our reach the

entire vegetable kingdom nor do we know

how to use it because we could have the

vegetable kingdom and we only grab sugar

the corn tortillas in the beans and

we're like that's the vegetable kingdom

no no that's not the vegetable kingdom

the vegetable kingdom is rather to eat

very very well so then the question has

been answered no meat has been bled the

meat is bled in all the countries of the

world and if it were not bled the meat

would go bad and the red stuff you see

is not blood so then I've already answer

the question let everyone be their own

judge and do what is most propitious in

their life for their health fair well

then and of course I'll go ahead and

clarify again did you have a question

since we want to know a little more

about health you know about mention

somebody got a surgery and what happened

because it didn't mean oh meat being as

it has all the proteins all the ones we

need as well as other building materials

like collagen in great quantities that

would help a wound heal quickly quickly

it was because of that the protein

needed to repair that was not found in

the proper amounts in the vegetable

kingdom to repair that there are many

cases for example someone that ain't

meet their whole life and that always

ate meat good meat bad meat and all the

rest fried foods and all the rest they

get to the eternal truth and they're

sick do you think that the most

propitious thing for that person is date

meat first then they've got to do is

abandon everything date before do the 60

day juice fest and then look for the

best nutrition basically based in what

is raw and adding some other things meat

would not be the solution for those

people being as those people ate meat

all their lives and what they need is to

clean their organism meat does not clean

your system I want to understand that

there's no way for me to clean your

system meat can repair certain things

that you may need complement some other

things but it'll never cleanse you or

purify you what

purifies and cleanses you are the

vegetables we know that from the get-go

right it supplies you with protein and

minerals and some other components but

it'll never fire you no one can say I've

purified myself eating meat I'm gonna do

sixty days of nothing but me do you know

how you can end up with the uric acids

so high problems of all kinds and you're

gonna say but you recommended it now I

didn't recommend anything I'm just

telling you what the trough says be

smart be wise and use everything that is

at your disposal that is all that I

thought okay some people say that

chicken broth exactly and they say that

it's to purify your water no it's

impossible

we're talking healthier Nami health

right there is no purification with meat

nothing animal athletes need me to

repair the broken TSU and the last thing

they're looking for is purification they

don't need purification they need

colleges to repair exactly exactly so

then I believe that everything that we

have taught and the eternal truth is to

make us wise to have all the tools at

our disposal if we prohibit meat has it

been a sin there are tools that you can

no longer use do you follow and a wise

man has everything at his disposal

everything at his disposal when he needs

something he uses it but if they take it

away from you you no longer have it at

your disposal so then a wise men knows

how to use what he has at his disposal

that's all that I've taught actually my

vision is that everyone be wise don't do

things just because I said so don't ever

eat meat and everybody stops eating meat

no no you be wise you make your own

decisions

learn what everything is used for and

know how to use them for when it is

necessary to use them just like a doctor

a good doctor a good doctor who has a

whole lot of Medicine good and bad at

its disposal thousands of thousands of

medicines but depending on the condition

he'll say this will help you

it'll compensate it'll eliminate certain

things that is what it is to use wisdom

that's what wisdom is you have to learn

to be why

to be was what is my advice to be as

natural as possible that is my advice

purification dar the 60-day juice Fest

is spectacular and to always lean more

towards vegetables instead of fruit all

the juices I've noticed a tendency that

people want to make them sweeter and no

know what is best are the green juices

with vegetables with enough fruit so us

to make it tolerable to swallow in other

words if I grab romaine lettuce cabbage

and other kind of green vegetables

parsley cilantro and everything else you

know you're all experts none but if I

add a whole quantity like this of apple

or pineapple or sweet things grape juice

oh what a delicious sweet juice now

actually the secret is in the nasty part

that's the key enough sweetness to make

it tolerable that's the way it is lots

of sweet has also its problems nut but

fruit juices has its problems that is

why do you see how when who hears the

problem of drinking apple juice and it

makes you get a stomach ache I have that

problem meant to has it who else kind of

laxative and I'm talking pain pain well

if you feel pain that means that pain is

produced due to the quantity of glucose

entering the stomach of a sudden that

pain the stomach and other functions

generate certain substances and that

pain is the glucose that doesn't happen

to us with the green juices it happens

with the apple juices maybe if you

overdo it with the watermelon that ever

happened to you with lots of watermelon

lots of watermelon in such a pain it

goes away though but that great lots of

grip to it happens to me with grape

watermelon and apples so then that is

the problem we're puttin lots of glucose

into our system and it has no cleansing

sense purification comes through

what's green what's nasty those ones

precisely that's where purification

comes the nasty ones just that enough

sweetness so that they can be swallowed

but not for them to be such a delight to

drink them if their delight it's not but

sugar tell you up front

yeah because lots of people think that

they're doing dar and every day nothing

but fruit grape apple and that's all

they're doing no no they're missing the

detergent and purification the healing

of many sicknesses are not found in the

fruit the friend in the green in the

greens we add enough fruit so that it's

tolerable that is understood right

farewell then like the fourth part

whatever it makes it tolerable for you

farewell then this is Yahweh a hot part

5 we have already understood the true

worship is considered by Yahweh to be a

sexual act with him and if we worship

another Elohim he says you are being

unfaithful to me and fornicating with

another Elohim that is why we have the

Shema what is the Shema say Shem i

Israel Yahweh Elohim Yahweh Ahad this

time we added it in this precious little

square made by Leslie for a different

presentation and it is beautifying my

desk and today's study we have only one

Elohim very well then the hour has

advanced and I'm gonna skip over certain

text we always read at the beginning

I'll just read one Isaiah 46 8 through

13 which I always read I love it in the

Martin Nia the version this text says

remember this and understand it well

come into reason ye sinners remember the

past from days of old that I am Elohim

and there is no other Elohim how many

Elohim are there outside of Yahweh now

other and none like unto me from the

beginning I announce

the end I'm from beforehand that which

has not happened I say and my decision

is carried out and all that I please I

make it come to pass from the Orient I

call the Eagle from a far-off country

the man

I have designated as I say it I do it as

I plan it I execute it hearken unto me

ye stout-hearted that are far from

righteousness I bring near my

righteousness it shall not be far off

and my salvation shall not tarry and

there will peace salvation in Zion and

my glory unto Israel now before I forget

I don't want to leave this pending I had

it in mind in one leave appending to

Shabbat ago in chapter 24 I said that we

will see this later but I told you that

Yeshua when he arose from the dead that

he no longer used the body that he had

used as a human being

well I'd like to add another point to

that because I also said that that body

possibly I cannot prove it but possibly

is the true fulfillment of the red hafer

and if it is the fulfillment of the red

hafer that body had to have been burnin

with those ashes real lashes to purify

the entire people of Israel okay very

well then now there's a detail that I

said the later on studying I said well

there's a variation what I said I said

that immediately after resurrecting that

body was left set apart it could be that

it was afterward it could be there was

afterward because for example in john

i'll read john john 7:38 through 39

john 7:38 through 39 he that believeth

on me as

scripture hath said out of his belly

shall flow rivers of living water thus

he spake he of the Spirit which they'd

that believed on him should receive for

the Holy Ghost was not yet given because

Yeshua was not yet glorified Ferelden

you sure had not yet been glorified what

does that mean for he is sure to have

been glorified it means that he again

became Yahweh that's what glorified

means to again be Yahweh now maybe he

didn't go back to being Yahweh until

after he stopped coming back to the

world maybe when he was resurrected I'm

correcting this when he was erected and

then he presented himself to his to his

disciples maybe he still used that body

but he always was Yahweh he was still

Yahweh he was still Yahweh but just the

body issue I'm talking about the body of

Yeshua the body that yah would never had

when he existed before ever since he

existed Yahweh that is so then the body

he took with Mary Mary provided the

genetics to that body that body when he

resurrected he probably did resurrect

that body but that doesn't mean that he

would be subject to that body for all

eternity he had to be glorified in that

glorification is possibly when he comes

out of that body for him to come out and

for the body to stop being or actually

for that body to be burnt and offered up

as the para D'Amato Herod Hafer are you

following what I'm saying because maybe

maybe I know that I told you that it was

immediately after no no maybe a couple

days went by 40 days 50 days or years

even I do not know it it is not revealed

what I do know is that when he presented

himself and he told them and he told

them come and touch my wounds and all

the rest so then possibly right there we

are seeing that he was using the body

that had received the wound we agree

with that but he had not yet been

glorified there do you see that

are you following he's

John says that the Holy Spirit they were

gonna receive it once Yeshua was

glorified so then when Yeshua comes out

of that body barely then well he sent

the Holy Spirit are you following does

it make sense what I'm saying

so then possibly it's almost surely so

he was directed that human body he was

seen by you see the disciples he had to

use that body so that they wouldn't see

how he really is and that body also had

the wound so then but we still agreed

that that body had not yet been

glorified so then they couldn't see him

now of course not you couldn't see so

then that party when he was glorified

maybe that body that is when it was

burned and the right of the parado took

place is what I've just said clear okay

then that was the Transfiguration have

anything to do with the fact we're

talking about a body right there right

what type of body was it was a a

glorified type body made of light now in

the Transfiguration they just saw you

sure filled with light that's it but the

three looked identical

while the three were compared to a

common human being they were kind of

glorious per se illuminated like a

Hollywood star filled with light like

that you have to also see from their

point of view in their mind place

yourself in their mind we have now

another type of vision we see an

airplane we see a helicopter and we see

things if they would see that I mean

just imagine what they would have

thought or this computer that I have

here or a smartphone what would they

have thought this was a small little

portable sea of glass so then I could

not say what they saw in the

Transfiguration Transfiguration means

the word means to change a form that's

all the word says he changed his form

with more light so then what I imagine

may be different to what you imagine but

who knows what they saw which is

different a lot more different yes now

Christine is we talk

about Transfiguration dummy men when

Mary went and she was they're asking for

where Yeshua was now when he spoke to

her she did not which we'll call it

recognize him didn't recognize him

exactly so Brienne when he presented

himself to her he done told her do not

touch me woman exactly for I have not

yet been which we call so then now being

as she was a woman I mean would he not

allow her to touch it cuz when he don't

present himself to the disciples he

allowed them to touch him yep

cuz he said he had not yet gone up unto

the Father we're gonna see what exactly

does that mean but he had yet to be

glorified Namie but when he returned he

had yet to be glorified either cuz he

said the Holy Spirit would really come

once he was glorified that is what John

says in the text I've just read I mean

it's interesting there are things there

are mysteries that we cannot completely

grasp but at least we are trying to

understand that which elohim once wants

to tell us through the parables through

the parables they also didn't recognize

him he presented himself in a different

way in a different way but that does not

mean that he already switched bodies

this one can say with that same body he

could transfigured in something else

okay very well then psalms two today we

shall read Psalms 2 which is another one

of those texts just like the one we read

proverbs 30:4 which we read last Shabbat

last study it's one of those texts that

we used to use to say see how they are -

it is clear that it's - the father and

the son well we shall recondition what

the true meaning of this parable is of

Psalms chapter 2 why do the heathen rage

in the people imagine a vain thing

the kings of the earth shall arise and

the rulers shall take counsel together

against Yahweh and against his anointed

Shan well in order to give you the

correct interpretation for this text I

also read all the possible sources there

is about the Jews themselves in Judaism

what they say about this text having

nothing to do with Christianity in

having they the closest thing to the

original it's all been transformed

absolutely transformed it's all been

transfigured exactly but in order to be

able to see how it is in the closest

thing to the original I have to go to

the vision of how they see things in

order to be able to give the true

meaning try to understand it okay first

of all who wrote this David wrote it why

did he write this because he was the

anointed king and all the kings wanted

to kill him the Philistines wanted to

kill him other allies of the Philistines

wanted to kill him some other gangs of

bandits wanted to kill him they wanted

to destroy and take Israel off the map

so then when I read here that it says

rulers take counsel together against

Yahweh who was and still is the elohim

of israel yah with the elohim of israel

and against his anointed we and the

Christians are like posse there's a

father and the son no the father son

right here

Yahweh was in it still Yahweh and who as

is anointed it is David it is David

there's no turn of the page David wrote

it and he's right on top of a prayer in

a type of a prophecy about almost to

happen so then I know it it came exactly

anointed king but most of them say

mushiya

it says Messiah but mashayekh means

anointed anointed with oil who are known

today

Samael so then was if he anointed or not

absolutely anointed we know that Yeshua

or David actually is a figure of Yeshua

King David is a figure of you sure that

is absolutely clear that is not open for

discussion right whether you like it or

not it's not open for discussion

David is a figure of Yeshua David's life

is not the figure of Yeshua but David is

the figure of Yeshua and the symbol what

David did in his life is not the figure

of Yeshua obviously southern curse the

Kings were anointed David Dunn say it

and he would not raise his hand against

the anointing exactly who was Saul who

will solve so then of course they were

anointed they were the anointed ones

anointed and selected by Yahweh farewell

and people would apply that to the past

was back in the church Norman never

there would be kind of a revolt the

pastor's because they had placed their

hands on them they were the anointed

ones they're like do not argue with the

Anointed One

The Anointed One is above you the

pastor's whether they understand things

are not very well then seven I'm

clarifying the symbols here the rulers

that counsel together are the

Philistines and the peoples that were

surrounding Israel but mainly it was the

Philistines southern the text is talking

about Yahweh and David who was the

anointed king of Israel the symbol

that's literally literally literally

Yahweh David in Israel the Philistines

that literal now in symbol because this

also symbol symbols is Yahweh and who is

the anointed of yahwah Israel Israel is

the anointed people for they are the

priests so then if we go more to the

point we're gonna be the anointed ones

the only anointed ones of Israel

the 144,000 son symbol it is Yahweh in

the 144,000 if we take it into

prophetically speaking for their hundred

forty four thousand Kahane and Kings

Southern if literally it was Yahweh and

David in symbols it is Yahweh and

144,000 kings of Israel is that

understood what I'm saying that is the

symbol that is the simple now the symbol

that we had that it was Yahweh Yeshua

that symbol doesn't go that symbol is

destroyed here that symbols no good

Yahweh Yeshua is absolutely improvable

that is not what neither Yahweh no David

are trying to give us to understand okay

then we're gonna see this in time so

then this was another one of the texts

that we had as a base in the doctrine of

the Godhead proverbs 30:4

Psalms 2 and then proverbs 8 which will

study later farewell then so then the

incorrect symbol is precisely the one we

used to say that was correct that it's

yahwah and you should know are there two

there no there are not two it is the

only limb there is and we've got the

Anointed One and if we want to see it

symbolic II you've got Yahweh and you've

got 144,000 farewell to verse 3 let us

break their bands asunder and cast away

their cords from us what does this mean

literally

let's kill David let's kill David let's

take over his land and let us destroy

the entire people of Israel along with

our eloheem because it's you know that

when our people will conquer another it

was very important to destroy their gods

because all of them knew that nobody

existed I mean they all knew tell the

truth I believe that humans knew if they

made them suffer God they knew but they

had to worship something they had to

worship something so then since they had

to worship something our

is this their God is that and when I

conquer you I destroy your gut because

my god I know they're both false but my

God is stronger than yours it's like the

flag it's like stealing the flag of the

other and putting up ours put in our

flag to conquer so then a part of the

conquering was to go if you dominated

the people you would destroy their gods

that was the part of war the war of

conquering you do understand what I'm

saying right

very well then so then it says let us

break their bands asunder and cast away

their cords from us they're saying let's

kill David let's conquer Israel and let

us destroy their Elohim come they call

Yahweh but here's the reply he that

sitteth in the heavens shall laugh

the Lord shall mock them the Lord not

only does he punish not only does he

love but he also mocks his enemies

Yahweh is the one that twelves in the

heavens do you see that if if Yahweh in

Yeshua was Yahweh the father in Yeshua

was the Anointed One here we have to

continue with that interpretation so

then the one that dwells in heaven is

Yahweh not as knowing - do you follow

that is why I can assure you that that

interpretation we had is erroneous it is

wrong but all of Christianity has that

interpretation we didn't come up with it

we inherited that from Christianity so

then as it turns out since it cannot be

that yahwah lives and a son Yeshua not

laugh and his son yasur's on earth and

y'all was in heaven laughing that

absolutely cannot be it is obvious that

the symbol of yahwah Yeshua is that it

it is the symbol of Yahweh in the

144,000 Israelite kings five then shall

he speak unto them in his wrath and vex

them in his sore displeasure

so then literally the Phyllis

teens and the other people's we're gonna

be defeated through David David

conquered them when he took the throne

when David took charge he conquered all

the peoples of the Philistines and made

Israel great great annihilated everybody

and the rest he subjugated but Israel

rested of the Philistines he destroyed

them all that's why the prophecy in

what's literal says then shall he speak

unto them in his wrath the wrath of

Yahweh who destroyed all those peoples

through David and vex them in his sore

displeasure

now that was literal but in that which

is symbolic because it's a prophecy

symbolically speaking which is the wrath

of Yahweh the day of Yahweh their Great

Tribulation the breath of Yahweh and it

is the wrath of Yeshua or Yahweh however

which way we want to call him now we've

got to go back in text 3 when it says

let us break their bands asunder and

cast away their cords from us what it's

saying in a symbolical level the world

is we don't want to know anything with

the Torah nothing let us break their law

that's what they're saying because in

the Torah as we studied in the so

marvelous text of proverbs 30 we studied

that no one no one could ever get to the

conclusion of who created the earth how

he created it and how many days it's

impossible so then when the world and

the kings get together against Israel

and against Yahweh and they say let us

break their bounds it's let's break all

the laws of Elohim that has been

fulfilled literally that is why the

world says the world was not created it

evolves the world was created by a Big

Bang Big Bang product of eeveelution

evolution which I've already told you

what the word means evolution

is an evil illusion wicked illusion that

is what evolution means a wicked

illusion so he created the wicked

illusion to replace the creation of the

Torah so then they replace the form in

which the earth was created replaced the

eloheem that created and replaced all

the form of the earth and of the

universe replaced everything that is why

this is a prophecy which will be

fulfilled so then the entire world

babylon said let us do away with all the

laws of elohim we don't want to know

anything about yahweh the elohim of

israel and yahwah answers that he left

at them obviously he's gonna laugh at

babylon he mocked them and it says that

he will perturb them with his wrath that

is precisely what we're waiting for him

to do up until now we haven't heard him

talk to anybody he has not spoken to

Babylon we see that Babylon marks us now

and marks Elohim and marks l'autre and

marks everything that the Torah says

Israel themselves are saying that

they're gonna get to the moon and that's

the way it is that's the way it is so

then what we're waiting for are for

precisely for Elohim to speak to them in

his wrath and that he vexed them with

his wrath where we'll then let us go to

verse 6 yet have I said that I is Yahweh

speaking yet have I set my king upon

zion my holy hill

this is literal literally who is that

King David and who is that I Yahweh

that's literally now symbolically

speaking the only one that said not out

of their choosing but the one who

disposed of programmed and predestined

them to be the Kings over Zion and

throughout all eternity is Yahweh and

were his Kings throttle eternity the

hunter

44,000 so then we always go back to the

same symbol Yahweh and 144,000 kings of

Israel that is why he says I have set my

king that king symbolizes the hundred

and forty-four thousand we used to call

them the supreme Saints the word supreme

is fine but Saints we should replace

them with Kadosh the supreme Kadosh and

that's even better the word expressed

those supreme Kadosh are the kings that

this prophecy says that clearly Yahweh

shall set of resign that's what

revelation says the 144,000 are the only

ones that are gonna live in the New

Jerusalem the need Jerusalem assigned

and they shall reign on the earth isn't

that what Psalms 2 is exactly sane

exactly exactly

once we interpret it correctly and now

we go to the text in question I will

declare pardon me before moving on to

this one I want to give the mistaken

symbol we had before because verse 6

says but I have set my king over Zion we

used to understand Aiyaa we have set my

king you sure over Zion the father said

his son of rezaian ha Glee's that

seriously how ugly is that Yahweh sets

his son Yeshua whose son does what the

father says nothing else if the father

sets him there

he says I'm making why because my dad

set me I don't have any power of myself

only what my father gave me everything

that I have my father gave me in fact if

you don't get lost

it's because my father keeps you you see

how all all that does not coincide with

an all-powerful or him that is you short

does not coincide or else why do we even

want you sure let's worship directly the

father the other guys just set there is

a puppet has no power hasn't I don't

know anything I receive anything with my

father says you sure I don't know

anything

the son doesn't know anything the father

knows it all why do we even want the son

tell me what for unless we understand

that it's a symbol it's a symbol it is

absolutely a symbol that Yeshua and

yahwah is the same person so then

this text could never be for it to say o

Yahweh have set my king Yeshua over Zion

it could never be

are you following what I've just said

that King are the hundred forty-four

thousand it was David literally David

but these are the hundred forty-four

thousand okay now let's go to seven I

will declare the decree and here's David

speaking I will declare the decree

Yahweh had said unto me my son art thou

I have begotten thee today and with that

text we use to say you see that Yeshua

was begotten by the father because

Yahweh has told me my son art thou I

have begotten V today not many years ago

but today and for him to tell him that I

have begotten to be today means he was

born an adult like Adam per se well as

it turns out this text has nothing to do

whatsoever with the birth of Yahweh who

is Yeshua nothing at all we understood

it incorrectly because if we're

understanding the entire chapter

correctly who is the son David David is

the son thou art my son I have begotten

V today what that means right there I

have anointed thee today I have

designated you as a son today over

everyone that is what the text is saying

nothing more than that

in the literal David says I am the son

of Yahweh I am The Anointed of Yahweh

and I'm gonna destroy he's talking to

the Philistines I'm gonna destroy all of

you

now that's literally another symbol my

son art thou we know who is the only son

of Yahweh on earth Israel Israel Israel

is the son of Yahweh on earth and Oh God

and read it to you I already did so last

you bet

but I'd like to read it once again so

that you remember it well Exodus 4 22

through 23 I'm gonna read to you only

two texts of those that I read last

Chevette Exodus for 22 through 23 and

thou shalt say unto Pharaoh Yahweh

speaking pagina Moses thou shalt sent to

Pharaoh thus saith Yahweh Israel is my

son even my firstborn I've already told

you to let my son go that he may serve

me yet thou has not wanted to let him go

behold I will slay thy son even thy

firstborn for that reason did yahwah

destroy killed annihilated the firstborn

sons of the egyptians that they

understand and see that they had messed

with the firstborn son of his literally

7 the son of Yahweh is Israel Hosea 11 -

I'll read from the Jerusalem 2001 Hosea

11:1 Jerusalem 2001 when Israel was a

child I loved him and out of Egypt I

called my son southern it is clear that

if it says here I will declare the

decree Yahweh had said unto me my son

art thou have become V today literally

it is David symbolically I mean words

David Frum was he a Philistine he could

not have told a Philistine you're my son

you see David is Israelite and David

represents all of Israel the symbol is

Israel but the maximum symbol are who

144,000 and we go back to the same

application in every text

yah we're speaking he's talking about

his elect Kings who will be so for all

eternity the 144,000 they are the first

born children of Yahweh they are the

firstfruits of Yahweh is that text

here this has nothing to do with our

Father speaking to yah we reassure his

son saying I have begotten thee today

I've become thee today yah when I do you

shouid be godly today and then from then

we're all like you see how he is

begotten we've gotten know this text

does not say it now that yah was the son

of the Father I don't I haven't the

least bit of doubt but this text is not

speaking about that that's what I'm

trying to say

ok verse 8 ask of me and I shall give

you as inheritance the heathen and as

thy possession the uttermost parts of

the earth if the father of Yeshua is

telling him that a son your eloheem you

will be the elohim of israel you will be

the creator of the world ask me and I'll

give you as an inheritance what's he

saying

I'll give you as an inheritance the

nations and is like wait father father

father there's still nothing created and

if I create the matter need you to give

me an inheritance or mine I created them

after all you see how there's a little

problem there will used to believe that

the father was given everything as an

inheritance to the son the son does not

eat any inheritance out of what he

created maybe an inheritance of

something else and inheritance should

not exist nor should it ever exist in a

world where no one dies

what is inheritance inheritance is when

one dies you leave as an inheritance to

your children or your wife you leave

them but was yours before but the

inheritance if there's no death we

cannot call it inheritance can you call

a gift of your father inheritance now

that's that inheritance if your father

gives you a car he buys you a new car is

that inheritance no what is inheritance

an inheritance is something that when as

it turns out he dies you'll receive

because it was his so

the text says asked of me the father

tells the son ask of me and I shall give

you for thine inheritance the heathen

never ever kid the father of Yeshua

give him the heathen as an inheritance

until you sure when you shows the

creator of it all

do you follow so then we were miss

applying this text because we were given

too much importance to the father when

the father is Yahweh who is he assure

himself

southern it is completely discarded the

previous application is this whole text

talks about once all person who's Yahweh

in relation to the 144,000 that's what

the text talks about Yahweh with David

literally Yahweh with 144,000 Israelite

Kings symbolically speaking and there is

no other possible application if you

wish to understand this as if it's

talking about two Elohim you're really

misunderstanding it I want to make this

absolutely clear that's what I'm going

slow because we are understanding things

that for many years we misunderstood are

there any questions about this text any

questions it is easy to understand their

well than easy to understand so then the

text says ask of me and I shall give

thee the heathen for thine inheritance

and for thy possession the uttermost

parts of the earth how does the father

of you should tell him your possession

will be until the ends of the earth so

then what does Yahweh own nothing you

see how it makes no sense it is an

insult to say that the father of Yahweh

speaking to Yahweh it is an insult but

did you know that all the Christians

understand it that way they understand

it not just ours the Adventists the

Christians generally the Sunday guys of

the Sunday folk understand this text

like that that it is the father speaking

to the son that is not speaking with

Israel

I'm telling you that so that you know

that it was not an interpretation of

ours now the interpretation was never

just ours the inheritance leaving this

subject aside something just came to

mind did you know that inheritance when

one dies one gives their lands to their

children when Israel conquered the land

of Canaan it was divided up among the

tribes and within the tribes it was

divided throughout families of those

tribes and everyone had their own land

when the paycheck of each one of those

families and tribes would die their

children would receive things in

inheritance we agree with that right

okay then that happens up until today at

a level on a different level but if it

doesn't happen to us because her

father's didn't have anything but if

your father's had inheritance that they

had lands if they had factories

businesses fortunes when they die it

passes on to the children whether it's

an automatic inheritance or if there is

a will or whatever the children get it

okay so that happens up until today but

what I want to tell you is imagine

yourselves in a world where there is no

death no death what inheritance could

the father give the son now a darn thing

so then let's imagine the new earth on

this new earth which Enoch says that

we're gonna have at least a thousand

children each a thousand children each

of us then let's suppose that we're in a

land that is limited as the NASA

presents to us let's suppose that the

earth is this table but round like they

say a ball a ball football so then let's

suppose that all the saints live the

kadosh live here there's no more death

no more death

so then they keep on being born new

people being born and every one that is

born will have a thousand children there

comes a point in which let's suppose

that at the beginning we received a land

of a thousand acres each of us a

thousand acres that Danilo has let's say

so then Danilo has a thousand children

well let's say he just has tens let's

begin with the first ten make it a nice

round hundred hundred okay 100 one

hundred children hundreds children once

the whole world is occupied because it's

all been divided it's not that there's

learnt to concur with the Christian mind

I'm talking do you follow so then the

entire land is divided like the Land of

Israel is divided there's no new land

it's all there

it's a table it's all it's all given so

then vanilla has 100 children where this

children gonna live in the land of

Danilo

Vanilla's not gonna die but he has to

start to divide his land and it divides

it into 100 and everyone a little square

tiny square it's still pretty big

because we're talking that Danilo has

lots of land it's still pretty big but

the years go by and every one of his

hundred children has another hundred

children everyone has to subdivide his

little squares no matter how long the

time takes that matter whether it's a

thousand years ten thousand hundred

years that doesn't matter

because when there's eternity there's

eternity there comes a point in which

there's nowhere you can live we do agree

with that right where the rest of the

children can live and so they're all

there we start to make a big huge giant

city on earth and we start to build

upward there comes a point in which no

matter how much you build you weren't

have lent you run out that could never

happen in a perfect world so then

there's no inheritance having a flat

earth the way I believe that the Flat

Earth is so extensively big that we

can't even fathom it and that we are now

per se in a land like this piece of

paper so you understand in our

maybe is a little point like this

enclosed under dome right there and the

land is absolutely mega gigantic and all

the known earth is a little tiny dot and

if it's necessary elohim makes it grow

even more and if it's necessary

you'll put suns all over the place is

there a problem with that there's no

problem so then but the center is the

earth the rest it keeps on growing and

growing and growing the center is what

we know as Earth in the center is

Jerusalem so then no matter how much it

grows Jerusalem will be as the

bellybutton the center of the earth that

is what I understand to be the truth and

the earth will continue to expand in a

flat way a ball could never continued to

expand do you see yet when it's flat

there always be seas all kinds of

beauties but always in an incredible way

talking about a living organism that

grows on its own exactly and if it grows

on its own even better that would be

spectacular

just like anything else grows like a

tree for the earth to also grow what is

the problem I don't see any problem with

that that is the only way which I

comprehend that the earth will be where

there won't be death and no inheritance

no inheritance of them without

inheritance all the newly born can grow

and grab a piece of land that they

choose and that's it we continue to

multiply and it concerns grow in the

land as the living organism continues to

grow continues to grow they'll be

fantastic and with eloheem living in the

center along with 144,000 kings and the

bride 144,000 kings and bride of eloheem

living in the center of all this flat

land it could be almost infinite not

infinite but almost infinite that's

interesting right that's the only way

that I see this to be possible in a land

with an eternal life yeah and with every

one of us having a thousand children and

not just one thousand thousands

and maybe even I mean I don't know go

outside somewheres yeah go outside

obviously to go outside maybe to do

other things but we'll see that later

but on this same earth since Yahweh

shall be raining from here I think we're

all gonna live here that's what I think

all of us here in this land will be

infinitely huge there will then Southern

asked of me he's speaking to the hundred

forty four thousand symbolically asked

of me and I shall give thee for thine

inheritance the nations who will inherit

the nations the 144,000 kings and as thy

possession the uttermost parts of the

earth in the end of it all will be the

owners of all the earth the 144,000

kings

do you see how all this makes sense it

absolutely makes sense start talking

about Yeshua and Yahweh it is talking

about Yahweh in the hundred and forty

four thousand nine thou shalt break them

with an iron rod like a Potter's vessel

thou shalt dash them in pieces I'll go

back to the previous one ask of me and I

shall give thee the heathen for thine

inheritance and the uttermost parts of

the earth for that possession we know

that literally that is David but David

did he possess anything else other than

Israel no nothing did David possess the

ends of the earth absolutely impossible

so then we see that David in that symbol

and that literalism for david has his

great limitations we see that right

there are complete limitations but in

symbolically speaking we know that what

he says will be literally fulfilled as a

symbol on him for four thousand shall

have the possession of the ends of the

earth and the inheritance of the nations

is this understood clearly okay let's go

to verse nine thou shalt break them with

a rod of iron thou shalt dash them into

pieces like a potter's

vessel obviously it was applied to David

when he broke them down - them into

pieces not just the Philistines now

we're talking about all the nations of

the earth that David conquer America

David did not conquer America nor Russia

and obviously not the ends of the earth

so then how is this applied it is

applied to the 144,000 it is clear just

look at the words thou shalt break them

with a rod of iron thou shalt dash them

in pieces let us go to revelation 2:26

through 27 he says exactly the same

words you should speaking says as

follows revelation 2:26 through 27 he

that overcometh and keepeth my works

unto the end I will give him I says

Yeshua who's Yahweh to him will I give

power over the nation's what did the

previous text say that he would have his

inheritance all the nations and Yeshua

says I will give him authority over the

nation's and he shall rule them with a

rod of iron and as the vessels of a

Potter shall they be broken to shivers

the exact same words Yeshua quotes from

Psalms - even as I received of my father

that authority and everything that Jesus

is talking about symbolically in a

parable everything that received the

father to rule over the nation's and to

have authority of the entire world

obviously you sure received it from

Yahweh who's the same person it says

that he will grant it over to the

144,000 it is more than clear so then

what the Psalms to talk about about

144,000 revelation demonstrates it

absolutely clearly 10 are the elders of

zion included they're the elders of zion

in what way could they be included but

they have conquered the world ah they

conquered the world but without yahwah's

favor in other words they conquered it

during the time of babylon but they will

receive the wrath of yahweh

they rule they rule but here it says him

that overcometh

in a provisional sense right but that is

not what is written him that overcometh

and keepeth my worse until the end

that'll be throughout eternity now they

have they who is Babylon those elders

have the power but that power will

precisely be take right now there's a

philistines per se in this aspect so

then i cannot apply it to the elders

because talking about a promise

throughout all eternity his people do

not have the power now in fact those

elders are those whom they're the ones

who came up with all the doctrines about

evolution and everything we see from the

nasa that's all a product of the elders

of zion all of it but yes they now rule

the world tonello that is true but upon

them will soon fall the wrath of yahweh

and they will be ruled by the hundred

and forty-four thousand farewell then

verse 10 okay 10 now therefore o ye

kings be wise now those kings

who's he referring to

let's read now therefore o ye kings be

wise now accept instruction he judges of

the earth serve Yahweh with fear and

rejoice with trembling honor the son

farewell then with this already it is

made clear who those kings are those

kings all the kings of Babylon I right

up until there so that you can seek with

clarity who those kings are southern all

the kings who are against Israel those

kings who want to destroy the king of

Israel who was david yahwah tells them

now therefore all ye kings be wise in

other words do not do what you shouldn't

do except in

destruction he judges of the earth all

the judges of the earth who are one more

corrupt than the next this is a clear

warning to Babylon for the Philistines

during the time of David and to Babylon

in our time serve Yahweh with fear do

you think Babylon will serve Yahweh with

fear then that means their distant four

destructions know that we're about it

but the message of Yahweh is serve

Yahweh with fear and rejoice with

trembling verse 12 honor the son who is

the son it's Israel it is David it is

David literally it is David if the

Philistines would have honored the son

who was David and would have said ok

we're not gonna mess with your land not

gonna mess with you would you I would

have destroyed them no he would not have

destroyed them but why did David destroy

them because they conspired against

David which in this case he is the son

of Yahweh

now this son symbolically is Israel but

in the most exact and final symbol are

the hundred and forty-four thousand

honor the son lest he be angry and ye

perish from the way right David get

upset and destroy them all now that son

who will be angry is the symbol of the

144,000 and those 144,000 will be judges

of all the earth of all Babylon so then

if they do things contrary to what

Yahweh told them to do and work

wickedness those children or the 144,000

will judge them and will destroy them

Jeff question yeah just in a certain

sense if that right there well if in

that case if David would not have cried

out

because he will surround it on all sides

exactly so then it's kind of luck now

that the bride cries out to y'all wait

for him to come and destroy that's the

only way to cry out our clamor must not

be cut off our clamor must intensify

itself I don't know how all y'all's

personal prayer might be but your

personal prayer must be of clamor

because we really don't want to wait

anymore

we're tired and really we do not see up

until today on action from Yahweh we

don't see it if you see it let me know

had a dream right because we literally

do not see that yo is acting it's as if

y'all was taking 2000 years of absolute

silence because before you talked to the

people the prophets I would love it I

mean tell you truth I mean I'm not sure

how your own personal relationship with

Yahweh is but how would I love to

actually follow somebody who says she

always speaks to me and I have a message

cuz she always speaks to me I obviously

don't believe anybody because they're

all a bunch of liars but if I knew that

a person is really spoken to by Yahweh

and he had dreams and visions Wow how

beautiful that would be but we have not

seen that in the last 2,000 years and we

won't see it just like that we won't see

it

so y'all return exactly that is why it

was nice to follow Paul because Paul had

gone up to the third heaven

it's nice Nurmi it was nice to follow

Ellen why because Ellen White would go

into those visions and we'd get these

brutal stories so then in this moment if

a prophet were to come I had a vision

last night and yahwah told me this is

that wouldn't that be spectacular but

yahwah has been incommunicado completely

for the last 2,000 years he doesn't

speak to us he doesn't give us visions

and all the ones who say that yahweh

speaks to them it is a lie yahwah has

kept absolute silence with humanity and

for that same reason we've got a cry out

we've got to cry out to see if once and

for all he shows up well know why

because people don't follow the Torah

yeah it's easy to find out exactly it's

easy to find out well that he is not

until you showed up I mean cuz you're

the one who brought but even so even so

let's say that guy shows up who follows

the Torah follows what he understands of

the trough but he says he always speaks

to me what are we gonna do there because

there are some of those also mind you

watch out because there are some of

those as well but unto the Lord the

testimony we'll see what their testimony

is the doctrine they speak something the

most important thing for me the most

important thing that you can draw of

what spirituality is spirituality

sounds nice in English spirituality in

order to find out whether someone has

the true spirit of Yahweh or not it is

what they teach of who the Elohim is not

the more that's it if this ministry

would have taught from the beginning

that they are three and that we worship

three in that or that they are or the

bear - because we used to teach that

they were - but we never taught to

worship - but rather that everything is

the Sun it's all about Yeshua therein

lies the secret of it all not visions

not know the secret is whom should we

worship and why whom should we worship

and why that's it that's absolutely

everything it's what has more value but

it's son guy comes along with visions

Wow how nice would it be for Allah him

to speak to somebody but him doesn't

speak to anybody that's the only thing I

can assure you of do I think that he

inspires me to understand things yes

that he has given me something to

understand things I believe it

completely but from that to say that

Allah speaks to me I once her peach this

a date no no not at all

he gives us virtues just like certain

soccer players like Maradona received

the greatest virtue to play football and

there's received the virtue of being the

king like King Pele those are virtues

those are virtues but it's not that

Elohim has constantly given them every

day do you follow that is the difference

that's the difference I believe that the

Lord has given certain of us deep what

he calls a measuring rod a deep

discerning a discerning of what is

written that is all that is needed you

don't need a constant guidance in the

ear no you don't need that yes and how

about when Maradona compliments another

player do you know whom he complimented

you demean the King yep whom did he

compliment

el mágico the magic one i'll meheeco

Gonzales I know that el Michael Gonzales

a great great player of football all

right tell the truth I used to like

football before but I liked it because

of the art now I know that it's all an

arranged business the games are all

arranged it's all garbage but within all

the crappy arranged games there have

been certain players that have been

phenomenal for example phenomenal

absolutely phenomenal one of them was

Alma haiku and Salas a rather phenomenal

Salvadorian player who played in Spain

and he's unknown nobody knows him but

Maradona himself would go and see him

train and play because he would like to

see him play but the guy was total party

animal he he didn't want to go train

didn't show up for training right

exactly exactly but seeing all these

World Cups football and all that we see

how the world is trapped in a sentiment

it is rather a sentiment the FIFA Cup

you see how if you look at it it is a

ball obviously ball is a ball supposedly

a soccer ball it's the world it's the

world which is bow and there's kind of

like a woman it's a demon if you were to

ask me something like that that's

holding it up just

look at pictures of the FIFA Cup well

that as it turns out is a star the Queen

a star the goddess Ishtar who represents

none other than a zoo obviously so then

the winning team the winning team takes

the cub and raises the cup and kisses

the Cup the only thing they're kissing

is a Zell himself that dragon is what

they're kissing to raise the cup is to

raise a star and they play for the ball

for football they're all gonna lose

except for one so then actually the joy

is for one and the rest is defeat defeat

in sadness countries like Argentina and

Brazil countries that are such

footballers part of their mind all it's

good for in things is at football their

brain has been possessed and all they

live and breathe this football both the

Argentinians

as well as the Brazilians that's why

among them there's such rivalry but more

than rivalry there's admiration

there's admiration in the way of how

that football is played but when they

lose it is rather as if there had been a

death in the family you have no idea the

mind of the Argentinian and the

Brazilian is rather left overwhelmed to

such a point that they go into an

enormous depression but that is achieved

through having been programmed since

birth that the most important thing

there is is football it is a national

duel only a Brazilian or Argentinean can

get this because I've seen when Mexico

loses nothing happens but in Argentina

they cry it is felt the lives of the

people are transformed you have no idea

what that is

they even grab their TV and break it

they commit suicide it's incredible it

is absolutely incredible

and no matter I mean just look at

football

Troy's the human mind in all aspects it

makes the country's become enemies

instead of enjoying and for it to be a

great moment they hate each other one

goes to war on the field they don't go

to have a nice time the football game is

war a battle to the death and if you

lose you cry and if you win you laugh

and mock the other it's euphoria

euphoric ly joyful and really that is

what I see of what the situation is

soccer is garbage just like that it is

garbage unfortunately it has been

instilled in us from childhood that

poison and they program that poison

illness and we played that football but

actually all it does has harmed the

world it doesn't benefit the world that

harms it in all aspects it harms the

world and it is completely entirely

arranged all the games you completely

see it like in this World Cup in mind in

mine personal football opinion is my

football opinion the best team that I

saw that I liked that I enjoyed the way

they played was Brazil for me I love the

way Brazil was playing and were

eliminated they were eliminated how they

were eliminated because I can assure you

I cannot demonstrate this but I can

assure you I cannot prove it one day

you'll see it Brazil just couldn't win

it was determined Brazil cannot wind I

mean

teams like Belgium it's impossible for

them to beat Brazil or anybody we're

talking amongst the teams that know how

to play that piece of garbage sport but

Brazil left in my point of view they're

out without being able to win because

they are not allowed to win that's how I

see it could I be wrong yeah I could be

wrong but that's the way I see it I

would really love to see that sport to

be completely destroyed which is that

benefit the world it harms the world no

it's not true what these people were

exactly

it is an illusion it is on illusion and

they play with the sentiments of the

people that is why in the final who went

to the finals

you've got France and you've got Croatia

both of those teams beat Argentina

against Croatia I've told you that this

guy Messi It was as if he were under

anesthesia he was a complete mess his

name said he was messy for what reason

well we now clearly see this our Jen

Tina was not to be allowed to beat

Croatia Croatia and France had to be in

the finals that's what it is that's what

football is that's what that piece of

garbage is the world drinks that poison

and it's just that the gives them

all to drink of the cup and they're all

how drunkards they're all drunk and the

other team who beat Argentina what team

is that France France beat Argentina for

two three four two three four two three

his friends better than Argentina no

they weren't better nor will they ever

be better because the players are

different but Franz had to win tell the

truth obviously friends had to win you

see because France is in the final and

crochets in the final they made Russia

lose in the last game they had to lose

in penalties but they had to lose it is

a proven fact because I've looked at

lots of information that it's almost not

seen it's a proven fact that Russia

arranged the games so that their team

not be ashamed they were the worst team

they're the worst of them all as it

turns out in the first game where they

win 5 to 0 where they wouldn't fight to

0 with the euphoric crowd putin issued

out three new laws which he published on

that day to raise taxes to reduce I

don't know what and augment something

else really harsh laws for Russia but

nobody even noticed nor cared because

Russia was winning five to zero

it is all arranged and at that moment

Putin issues out those laws and then we

see Putin inviting Blatter Blatter who

was the president of Switzerland or the

FIFA the most corrupt of them all along

with Avalanche who was also there for

many years people like this he had to

leave Blatter is his name right Joseph

Blatter he had to leave FIFA because

they found out all his dirty

arrangements that he had we're talking

of millions of dollars the guy had to

quit even a politician came and threw a

whole bunch of money in his face

football is so dirty he had to quit but

before the World Cup before the World

Cup Putin invited Blatter

and he invited some of the guys Maradona

and all the rest do you know why because

it is all arranged completely arranged

southern Russia to win that day they had

to kill on the field and leave Russia

euphoric leave them euphoric so that he

would issue some horrible laws you don't

believe me look it up online I've got a

tent to explain today but it's all a

filthy arrangement they play with the

sentiments of the people and the result

is that that entertainment which is that

way people have fun the world's over

they don't know in what world they live

in they don't see reality exactly they

don't see reality and through all that

they are deceived it's as if the people

are drugged and they live in sweat

soccer and they don't know that they

live in a fantasy world because even the

soccer they admire is false it's an

entertainment but that entertainment in

all the footballing countries it is life

and death they live for soccer and die

for soccer

but I remember that Native Americans

that would play football south of the

border in Mexico right and if you lost

you died no no the winning team would

die the winning thing right because it

was an honor to die it was an honor to

be sacrificed to the gods southern the

winning team would be chosen for their

sacrifice why do you think Mexico never

wins that's why I've always told you

you're never gonna win anything because

it's in your DNA ever since your country

became a nation that you have to lose

because if you become champions

then it's off of their head so then

they're never gonna win absolutely

anything I've already told you that

because it's Hardy in your DNA to lose

the winning team is sacrificed

I've a there are so many things in

football but oh well if that trophy is

the goddess ishtar the trophy do you see

the level the level of contamination

there is at a symbolic level symbology

and Satanism directly of the dragon

absolutely it goes way past

entertainment it goes further than that

it is a worship exactly worship farewell

then moving on then or another symbol

I'd like to tell you another symbol did

you see how Maradona showed up right

there with his arms like this you saw it

right well if you didn't he had his arms

crossed up here did you see him when the

player from France scored a goal and BOP

it what symbol did he make the same

symbol it's an Egyptian symbol that's

base onyx symbology and as it turns out

if you were to observe not enjoy mind

you but observe that spectacle you start

to see symbols those symbols which I've

just mentioned are from Masonic

symbology and that indicates many things

maybe the ones that do it don't even

know what they're doing but they're just

told when you score a goal do they

if you score another goal to this other

thing it is absolutely clear they are

symbols that come from from Egypt just

imagine from Egypt Ferelden southern

honor the son lest he be angry and ye

perish from the way when his wrath is

kindled but a low blessed are all they

that put their trust in him actually

here it is talking about it is

absolutely talking about Israel did you

know that we've got to trust in Israel

because Israel which are we have the

Torah if we're to say we we don't need

the Torah we don't need anything the

Christians are like we'll just keep

Jesus just Jesus but what race was Jesus

Jewish and Israelite he was an Israelite

Jewish Israelite so then is there any

truth that has ever come through a non

Israelite no none whatsoever

no truth whatsoever has come thrown on

Israelite Southern we've got to trust in

what Yahweh has given through the son of

Yahweh and who is the son of Yahweh

Israel Israel is the son of Yahweh I

shall read this in the Jerusalem 2001

Psalms 2 11 and 12 in the Jerusalem 2001

serve Yahweh with fear trembling kiss

his feet lest he be angry and ye perish

for his wrath is kindled in an instant

blessed are they that hold on to him

notice it doesn't say honor the son

it says serve Yahweh there's a great

difference that really I had to go and

look I had to go look what the Hebrew

shade because tell the truth

they can't just translate serve the son

and serve Yahweh which of the two is

serve the Sun or serve Yahweh it

actually makes all the sense if it were

to say the way in Jerusalem says serve

Yahweh not serve the Sun but rather it

makes more sense to serve Yahweh do you

follow because the life of Yahweh is

Yahweh's I explained it first the way

you have it in your Bibles but in the

Jerusalem it translated this way to

serve Yahweh with fear

trembling kiss his feet lest he be angry

and ye be perished for his wrath is

kindled in an instant blessed are they

that hold on to him ok let's go to

tourism at Psalms 2 11 through 12 Taurus

amat in English in the King James it

says honor the Sun kiss the son daughter

summit what's it say

serve Yahweh with fear and rejoice in

him it doesn't say honor the son but

rather serve Yahweh with fear and

rejoice in him possessed always with the

holy trembling embrace the holy doctrine

list Yahweh be angry at the end and he

be perished from the way of

righteousness because from a little

while from now his wrath be kindled

blessed are all they that put in him

their trust

ok then the versions in Hebrews say okay

David wrote it in an Aramaic Hebrew

that's very ancient they say we don't

know what he says here we don't know if

he says Yahweh we don't know if he says

the son it is a little unintelligible

that's why everybody translates over

where they won't they don't even

understand so then what does it say it

doesn't matter what it says what I

understand logically the wrath is the

wrath of Yahweh the one who saves is

Yahweh so then it's got a lot more logic

that instead of saying honor the son it

says honor Yahweh there you have the two

versions

if it's the Sun or the Sun I clearly

understand it but if it's a Sun or

Yahweh I understand it clearly and it

makes even more sense farewell then in

some versions among everything that I

had to study in Hebrew it says we don't

know whether to translate the Hebrews

themselves they're not Christians mind

you there so we don't know if to

translate honor the Sun kiss his feet or

kiss the grain that's what we have

literally they say and there is no way

of agreeing amongst themselves because

the letter since they don't have the

letters and all the rest you could read

whatever just like that

whatever farewell then so then it is

clear that this entire chapter that ends

here

it is absolutely left clear that it

talks about Yahweh that he is the only

elohim of israel and there is no other

and his son who is israel which in that

case was David who was the king anointed

but it is actually talking symbolically

prophetically about the 144,000 who are

the children of yahweh elect anointed

and who will also be his bride

it is absolutely clear Psalms 2 so that

no one has any doubt whatsoever of what

we were taught of course if you look if

you go and watch star and you see the

Godhead I am teaching an entirely

different thing there about the Godhead

but I mean that's fun because if there's

someone new and they've got to learn let

them start by leaving the Trinity at

least this has art become a little more

deep maybe they'll never want to

understand but if they understand at

least the Trinity that they are not

three but rather at least there's a

father and a son that's the first step

and the second step is to understand

that the father and the son are same

person but it is a step like in the

ladder like in a ladder say hey Chris

grace yes

I'll answer go ahead now who are you

saying that the father and son is one so

person is it under the context there's

only one name noun on earth which is

Yahweh I don't get your question for me

it's one sole person without the name it

is the same person yeah yeah we know the

name of the Father I mean the name of

the dad of Yahweh we do not know it we

do not know it nor is it mentioned

that's the context exactly that's why

Yahweh and Yeshua is the same person

there's only one Elohim whether we call

him Yahweh are you sure it's the same

thing it's the same thing because the

one who is Yahweh made him shall be

known as Yeshua it's the same thing

that's why for that same reason we are

precisely advancing in the depth of the

truth for me this marvelous absolutely

marvelous and let me tell you I was

thinking last week the people that

watched our that to me that program is

absolutely marvelous that program is now

running to the Godhead it is the Sun

then we have the Holy Spirit and they're

gonna listen to these texts explained in

a different way but maybe it is

necessary to come out at least from a

Trinity that they may have in their

heads very well then so as to wrap this

up because of the time I am NOT gonna

read John I'm not gonna read John

because tell you what to edit a short

video of approximately two hours it is

more pleasant to edit for me tell the

truth and also for you to watch because

there are so many so many so many videos

to watch and review and it is really

pleasant to study something that's short

and concise because if we Center today

in what we have studied and what you

have received of Psalms 2 and you

understand it well and you review it

then you'll not have doubts again if you

understood it today when you heard it a

year from now passes and you remember it

you know what you'll remember the father

and son I mean it is automatically

that's the way it is that's the way it

is

if you do not put it into your heads

very often very often until it clicks in

your mind and that information is

already left there today I understand it

tomorrow you'll remember it a year from

now you don't remember what it was

talking about oh yeah follow the son the

father and son that's what comes out

automatically right exactly

so then as it turns out it is very

important and I'd like to go back and

review I'd like to again but go back and

view about last Shabbat I give you an

interpretation of John 3:16 for Elohim

so loved the world that He gave His only

begotten Son that whosoever believeth on

him that perish yet have eternal life

I gave you an interpretation that aside

from him becoming the son also that son

the way it is written is Israel for

Elohim so loved the world that He gave

Israel or gave Israel what for that

whosoever believeth on Israel which is

in the Torah which is Israel the Torah

so that whosoever believed on the Torah

what not perish yet have eternal life

it is rather very absolutely very

interesting that explanation is John

4:22 I read it to you but I do it again

John 4:22

no one speaking is you sure with the

woman a Samaritan woman and he tells her

ye worship what you know not how ugly is

it to worship what you know not Algie we

you should speaking the Jews right there

he doesn't present himself as a lame but

as the Jews he's talking to the

Samaritan woman he says you Samaritans

worship would you know not but we'd the

Jews worship what we know for salvation

comes from the Jews the Samaritan he

tells her salvation comes from the Jews

it's as if I don't know just I

understand as if an Argentine were to

tell

a Brazilian we play what you know not

but football comes from Argentina just

an example dumb example a dumb example a

dumb example so you understand what you

should say in here an example that I

gave you don't get offended you guys

play but you do not know the true

football comes from Argentina which is

true which is true absolutely which is

true but historically it comes from

England because who invented football it

was precisely the Masonic house whose

name I can't remember right now it was a

Masonic house in England they invented

football and then they said we're gonna

play it this way and from there they

took it to the countries but the

Englishmen were taken precisely in

Argentina and they established it there

that's what the names of the teams of

almost all the groups in Argentina

their names are in English he knows

juniors why juniors if that's a English

Newcastle boys almost all the main

football clubs have an English name why

because they established football in

Argentina southern actually the English

have the right to say that the British

can say ye play what you know not but

football comes from us not Portugal

Portugal not was the English who

invented it the English I never

mentioned Portugal the English Brazil

was conquered by Portuguese conquered by

Portugal yes exactly Celine yeah they

play what they know not they copied a

game just like Colombia but they play

well ok I like the way they play they

play well they play well but football

comes from England there's another way

about it and comes from the Mason

so the Mason's made it up so let's start

where does football come from where

they're any good can come of it can any

good come of it the Mason's came up with

it what good can come of it ok then bear

well done Sullivan issue says for

salvation

comes from Yahweh is that what it says

no doesn't say that he says salvation

comes from the Jews and if the salvation

comes from the Jews

John 3:16 is perfectly applied to Israel

Matthew 5:14 Yeshua tells the Israelites

not just not just his disciples he is in

the sermon of the mount talking to

thousands of people

what is used to say ye are the light of

the world he does not tells disciples he

says it in the Sermon on the Mount in

Matthew 5 speaking to thousands of

people those thousands of people what

race were they they were all Israeli

tell some ye are ye Israel are the light

of the world a city that is set on a

hill cannot be hid and that city is

Jerusalem set on Seven Hills

so as to wrap this up and make you think

I'm gonna give you some extra

information here because there'll be a

while till we get another chapter of the

Great Tribulation because I've already

concluded with what I was going to teach

you today in Yahweh had today we talked

exclusively about Psalms 2 there's time

for everything and everything wait but

I'd like to show you something here on

the board so that it something's very

clear you already know because I've

already explained to you you're here you

already know this but for the eternal

truth in other words let's write this

here this period of time we'll say we'll

give 69 shovel 69 but from what time is

it when we talk about short it is not

even from the independence of Israel but

it comes from wind from Chevron exactly

from Sherwood exactly southern chef

would our for 50 days after firstfruits

did I just lose you but still with me

still with me okay

from chef would serve on the feast of

Shavuot Shah let's make this video a

little more like this Shah Vaught from

the feast of chef would and every one of

these will be chef what every one of

these lines from the feast of shall walk

69 it was from the year it was from the

year let's put 70 right here number 70

which was the year we lived through the

70th year I'll put it in red the 78th

year we're gonna add right here number

71 let me scoot this line a little bit

higher let's put here 70 first it's just

a different color how about a green a

green year 71 farewell then so then

every one of these lines are chef wood

okay chef wat chef what chef wood very

well number 70 when did we live it when

did it begin during chef what of the

year 2017 that's when the 70th began and

it ended chef what of the year 2018 this

was the period of the seventy okay

farewell then and the 71st will end

obviously in 2019 were already live in

seventy first we agree right when we

started chef world where all them do you

see how I told you that everything

begins in Aviv why a viv whiny son it

gives us the month of creation it is the

month in which Yahweh formed everything

it is the month in which he began

everything so then there's the month in

which he will also begin the last

destruction it is the month in which he

begins the feasts of Yahweh the first

piece of Yahweh and all that so then

precisely jump ESSEC which comes before

chef or passer comes before because chef

what are

approximately 50 days after peso a

little more because it's 50 days after

bhiku team who which is firstfruits

let's say 50 days after Pesa 50 days so

then chef what comes afterward you do

agree you are following me okay if in

Kilauea let's write here Kilauea a

little red dot there volcano Kilauea the

volcano of Kilauea hey that begins the

initiation of the destruction from the

last period I find it well but then it

began on the 70th we're none of the

seventy-first yet because the pisaq we

celebrated what pair doesn't begin to

the 70th the 70th correct the 70th so

then if the destruction began on the

70th there it would not be fulfilling

the part where it says once the 70 years

are up after the 70 years do you follow

the phrase after once they have been

fulfilled to 70 years actually if it'll

begin during PASOK it should begin

during Pesach of the year 70 first here

when we're about to enter into the 72nd

at the end fifty days prior when it is

Pesa barely then we can say during this

PASOK

we're already after the 70th in the 71st

do you follow because they can't begin

at the end of the 71st yes it's

obviously obviously it can also be the

72nd the 73rd or the 74th who knows

whichever I'm not saying that the 71st

is automatically but if we're gonna be

technical and the word that says once

the 70 years are up as it says in

Jeremiah chapter 25 it says exactly it's

as follows the Jeremiah chapter 25 12 in

it shall come to pass when the 70 years

are accomplished that

we'll punish the king of Babylon when

they're accomplished or after they

accomplished technically the PASOK we

lived in they had that been accomplished

yet that's what I'm getting at do you

follow that you clearly understand it

technically they had not been

accomplished yet to be accomplished and

we'd get to travel that's when they got

accomplished so then the first Pesa the

first Pesa would be PASOK of the Year

2019 of course it would already be when

in 2019 it would be the year 2019

because the Babylon akhir changes here

that is all I wanted to say now if

Yahweh begin here in the 70th I find it

perfectly well because the world is not

yet the truth is that the word is not

yet in tribulation but that doesn't mean

that it has not begun so then I'm

telling you possibly

I'm not discarding that it hasn't begun

because this has already begun

on the second day or the third day of of

matza so then if this has begun that's

fine that is why Yahweh has not stepped

on the accelerator too much under

destruction if we see destruction a

little while firm a drink this year then

we will know that it has already begun

but the possibility technically fits in

that it would begin next Pesach or the

one after that tell truth I don't know

but it is another piece of data that I'd

like to share with you yes Armando you

want to say some catastrophic are a

great tribulation level it is local it

is absolutely local but it calls our

attention and that just that volcano but

a whole lot of other volcanoes got

activated all over the place in the

Galapagos Island there's another volcano

is also shooting out fire what about the

volcano in Guatemala that was

catastrophic right there in Guatemala

even though it could be like the

anteroom we cannot consider it to be

already within the period compared at

the Great Tribulation I absolutely do

not consider that we're in the Great

Tribulation visibly I don't consider it

nor do you nor do you

the ones who are in tribulation are a

couple footballing countries because

they were eliminated from the World Cup

they are in tribulation but that's not

the one we're expecting right that is

not the Great Tribulation so that we

don't know evidently we're not in Great

Tribulation right now that doesn't mean

that parrot hasn't begun because the

parrot could have begun and alert at any

moment will make tribulation visible but

that does not take away from us to say

well the first pet SEC after the

seventieth will be the PASOK of the Year

2019 that is all I wanted to communicate

to you Alleluia

to every one of you Yahweh is our only

Elohim the elohim of israel salvation

comes from israel let us conclude with a

word of Prayer beloved Yeshua that art

in heaven we thank you Lord because you

honor us to be able to understand what

is written in your word Lord we thank

you because really when we achieve to

comprehend what is said in everything

that is written in your prophecies we

can see the clarity in how everything

takes a clear space that you are our

only eloheem and that salvation comes

from Israel Lord we cry out for justice

we cry out that your return be soon we

desire to live with you forever and we

don't want to live on this Babylon

anymore I ask you that you forgive our

faults and sins and that your return be

soon because we are waiting for you all

this we implore you in the precious name

of Yeshua HaMashiach we shall meet again

next you bat may the Lord bless you and

keep you
