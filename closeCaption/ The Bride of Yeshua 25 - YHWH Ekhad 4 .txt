shabbat shalom lineage of the eternal

truth and friends accompanying us on

this so precious yet absolutely heed it

day of Shabbat here in California we

will have another study here in

California it is really the closest

thing to hell there is right now we are

literally getting cooked when we go

outside so it's an extremely hot of them

as the word says it California means

burning hot California fournier means

oven and kelly from hot it is precisely

the land of the oven the hot oven land

and it is literally burning hot here

we got a brutal hot wave coming in and

it really is very hot we even saw a

couple of birds yesterday who came to

seek refuge in the shade but they appear

to be practically dead because they were

really dehydrated dehydrated and and

rather stunned by the heat the heat is

rather brutal that were feeling here in

California it feels like 119 Fahrenheit

the thermic situation 111 but 119 and

that's in their shade mind you that's in

the shade always but in the shade always

in the shade I mean in the Sun forget it

it is an impressive heat maybe it's not

like in Australia I watched some videos

of the roads actually melting have you

seen those the semis on the road have to

stop because of the asphalt gets stuck

to their wheels I mean it is impressive

tell the truth it's impressive where the

farthest part away from the Sun Rise

we're not that close but then why

exactly why it's an order exactly and as

we know as I've already explained to you

that the Sun is not a source of heat or

rather that the Sun in itself does not

have heat the heat is cold the Sun is

cold but the heat is produced down here

because it is a law of magnetic

irradiation and down here is where the

heat is produced but actually the Sun is

cold and actually it is so hot that they

say I don't know I didn't see it in the

news even if we see them they are not

all that credible that in Canada a whole

lot of people died I mean in Canada due

to the heat I heard it in many different

newscasts obviously videos from YouTube

and all the rest that in Kennedy a whole

lot of people in Vancouver have died due

to the heat wave but I mean Canada for

crying out loud

70 Fahrenheit and they're dying all over

here were a hundred and twenty in the

Sun yeah and that right there is

actually their strong top 40 over 40 yes

over 40 but I mean it's all relative

everything also depends because of the

humidity there are many things that

affect the factor feeling the heat the

atmospheric pressure many things

influence of how the heat is felt and

you guys in the desert are even harder

right and we were talking heat heat heat

that is absolutely strong very well then

but on this heat at Chabot which is the

23rd of Sivan sivan zone that's way out

we're but talked about that last Shabbat

of Sivan this is the year five thousand

nine hundred eighty seven in the better

estimation that is possible to make with

the Scriptures the seventh of July of

the year 2018 in the Roman Gregorian

calendar in we shall study the bride of

Yeshua chapter twenty five a series

which most of you thought that it was

already over and forgotten that series

but that series has a lot more still a

lot more chapters ahead and today we

shall study yahwah a hot number four and

I warn you there are many more coming

because we've got to cover the doubts

cover a whole lot of text to talk about

the father and the son and how do we

conjugate these things actually never

has the message of the eternal truth

changed it has not changed

we're just readjusting for those of you

that think that the message has changed

the message has not changed really

because it has always printed in this

ministry ever since it's been born that

the Creator that the only one that would

speak with men that spoke with with all

the human beings of Earth who spoke with

Israel who spoke with the prophets who

spoke with everybody the only one was

Yeshua and Yeshua is Yahweh because you

should did that exist at that time

you sure as a new name that yahwah took

when he came to earth southern yahweh

always communicated himself with men in

yahwah is not the father but the son

will we saw it in that way and when he

came to earth yahweh the son came we

used to think that there were two

yahwah's yahwah the father yahwah the

Sun or elohim the father and the son and

that's the only thing that we're

reaching the doctrine our horrible name

did not change the teaching did not

change we're understanding things better

before we used to think only two and now

we say only one the only two is the form

in which it was made to be known but

only one is what we now understand

clearly that Elohim makes himself be

known in different things and versions

and forms hold on just a moment got cut

off if Facebook cuts off and we can't

see it don't you worry

you've got another excuse to watch the

videos because many of you it would

seem as if it is simply enough to listen

live and you've already understood the

entire subject you're not to review

anything everything has been left clear

you know watch the videos it is really

important to watch the videos it is very

important because even if you have

understood when you listen to it the

second time you remember it better if

you understand at all let's say you

understood it all which that's never the

case but let's suppose that in your mind

you're convinced that you understood it

all that null you will lose it if you

don't watch it again and repeat it so

then it is very very it is very

important I mean I'm telling you this

because it happens even to me

I speak them in with the time I forget

even what I said I have to be reviewing

because our mind is not perfect did I

say that did I ever say that it happens

all the time because it's lots of

information see that's what happens our

message is not one that's repetitive

present in the same thing all the time

so then what happens is that certain

points start to be taken down so as to

give way to more information in our

brain is rather imperfect so then watch

the videos take the time to put a like

you can leave a comment as well that way

you make sure that you remember it I

mean at least there are more chances of

you retaining it for longer because even

if we watch it 10 times you still forget

yes exactly in our thoughts

once we watch it again yeah that happens

it happens it happens all the time when

you're studying a certain subject you

can't just read all the books and you

understand it all understood everything

yes what are you gonna remember it

exactly and then when you get a

complicated question there's the problem

see there's a problem okay let us

address our Elohim by respectfully bow

our heads

beloved Yahweh that art in heaven will

give you thanks Lord because you give us

life and you give us this chance of

studying your word I ask you Lord that

your spirit be and every one of us we

really wish to see you soon you come and

look for us

we really wish for this whole world of

sin and wickedness of injustice to end

soon that we can live in your kingdom

forever all this

I implore you in the precious name with

which he descended to earth and made

yourself be known as a human yeshua

hamashiach the lord has blessed with

another year of life the following

members of the eternal truth Martha

Sanchez Mexico Jose Josue Gabrielle

Herrera Venezuela Karolina bucardo

Nicaragua luis brevis Correa Chile Lidia

she wasn't here so I'll take the time

not to greet both of you and we're gonna

celebrate both of your birthdays so the

Nelson and Audrey very happy birthday

and many blessings and today we'll

celebrate both of your birthday's which

are one day or two days apart one day

apart so then many blessings to all of

you me I will bless you and keep you as

well as the rest of the members of the

eternal truth this week I've been asked

I'll repeat this again because there are

many new people listening and they asked

me why don't you use the word family

what's the problem with family well

family first of all I advise you to

watch a series called which has not been

translated because it mostly analyzes

the pitfalls of Spanish the series is

called and it was given him power over

all tongues who was given power of all

tongues the Dragon and the dragon did

what he pleased with the tongues he put

him blasphemous name

he mocks everything is about worshipping

him and many other things that have to

do with neuro linguistic programming in

which we try to say something but

something else comes out so then what

we've got is that Dee synchronization

between what we want to say and with

what our brain actually understands and

that's the problem the problem of

communication the word family comes from

the word families and the word farmers

comes from hunger so then the word

family if you look it up you can still

find it in Wikipedia which means a group

of starving slaves so when you say this

is my family what you're saying is this

is my group of starving slaves and so

then that's why we don't use the word

family I know that it sounds so nice

family Evans's were born we have it

integrated in our operative system here

as a good word this is my family the

family but what you're saying is not

what you're trying to say what you're

trying to say is lenio to us we're

trying to say which is the lineage of

blood which is a group that has one name

surname in common that's why we don't

say family now does it accidentally

escape us yes does and if we want to

interpret the name then yeah we are

family why because we're all a group of

slaves we're all slaves to Babylon

system we're all still slaves and we're

starving out of hunger for justice yeah

we could apply it all yeah and that

since we are a family a group of slaves

of Babylon starving out of the hunger

for divine justice exactly that's what

the family is that's what a family

consists of southern there's no need to

interpret the word by looking for

outlandish terms right you know I'm

talking about strange terms like that

but rather earns out the word family is

a group from a time in which the world

was more visibly enslaved and we're

still enslaved just differently and are

still starving

either way tell me why is the world

starving because everything that is

given them by science is false so then

actually they have no

knowledge they have a lot of false

knowledge they have no true knowledge

they have not the true reason of all

things so then what happens is that that

actually people are starving all kinds

of starvation and the way it is

prophesied in Amos that says that at the

end of terms the people will be starving

for what for the word the true word

they'll go from coast to coast starving

for knowledge but the people don't know

that they are starving now but when the

things that are to happen stir to happen

they will appeal and draw upon the God

that they know or which was taught to

them and don't know that that's not the

true God and will be gone around

actually starving looking for the word

and it'll no longer be a time to listen

farewell then

oh and they also asked me about the word

brother in Spanish I mean what's the

problem brothers are brothers and stuff

the word brother in Spanish has on

different connotations maybe not as evil

but it's still I mean it's not as bad as

family in the meaning the word brother

in Spanish comes from had mono or German

Oh German Oh or German that's the way

that word is related to the root

Germania Romania or the Germans were the

Barbarian group no they're not the

Vandals but they were evangelists like

family the most evil you could think of

the most dragon worshiping people there

is these were the peoples that lived in

Germany in Germany and a long long long

time ago way before England ever

appeared a group from them went and

found it for example England which means

the land of the Angels ange land in ange

angel and the Anglos are the angels but

what angels fallen angels of course

obviously so then they went and founded

England so then from the land of the

fallen angels then they came in

colonized America at least the part of

the US because Spain would a Spain mean

it comes from Pan the devil so then the

fallen angels and the Devils from Spain

they conquered America and boy did they

call

in decolonized it is so then all that is

the programming of the language

unfortunately we have to continue to use

the words that's I don't worry much

about the words don't worry about the

words at all

I just correct some so as to not be

blasphemous with the names of Elohim

just like holy priests and Spanish is a

pig a holy pig and the words saint comes

from the word satan but i tell you this

because there are many people that don't

get what we don't use brother why don't

we say family well there's the reason

why we don't say brother and why we

don't say family so then brother in

Spanish is Germans the German O's who

were worshippers of the serpent and

Herman mean serpent at some point in

time ago before we even existed you

would call Herman Oh something that was

satanic the term Herman no you're either

supposedly Christian or hermano

that's where he also get Armani Armenia

and through Latin we got Herman Oh

which means brother Spanish hermano it

is the story of the language very well

then time to look for the moon as I've

told you this is the last bat of the

third month which bears the name of

Sivan and this Friday this upcoming

Friday after work I'm gonna explain

everything well so you don't get

confused after working after wrapping up

all the chores when the week of work is

on as sway out in the Shabbat is bed to

start go out to look not just the sky in

the moon but also when you start to keep

the Shabbat that's where you will see

the moon and it is important that we see

the moon for the 29th day of the month

but the moon will show up I'm telling

you up front it'll show up it'll be

visible so then go out take pictures if

you don't take pictures on how many

problem just I saw the moon in this city

at this hour that is all I need and if

you are a member of lve the lineage of

the eternal truth we'll take your word

as if it were a picture but if you tell

me we saw it at 11:30 at night

I cannot believe you because the moon is

stuck to the Sun I'll go ahead and

repeat this the Sun Goes Down and the

moon goes down how long after sundown

must you state at least minimum 45

minutes cuz some are still wondering

about how long once the Sun Goes Down

not that you don't see it because of a

mountain because there's that confusion

about what if you don't have an to

horizon the Sun Goes Down behind a

building or a mountain there like all

the sun's down now the Sun has not gone

down it has not the Sun goes down from

the horizon not from your horizon from

the horizon it is barely when the Sun

Goes Down the true horizon that there

are 45 minutes in which you can look for

the moon you're obviously not gonna see

the moon as soon as the Sun goes down

because it's too much light you

generally see it as soon as two stars

appear you gonna look at the sky and you

always see two or three stars that

appear once those two or three stars

appear and it's still lighter that's

when you can see it but do not give up

and go home yet you like the Sun went

down it's been 15 minutes since the Sun

went behind that building over there and

as it turns out it is still right below

the actual true horizon not being the

building or the mountain or whatever we

have there that intercepts your vision

so then actually wait for the Sun to go

down and if you're not sure when the Sun

Goes Down

just look up online on myself and our PC

which are you like look up what should

you write sunset in English or puesta

missile in Spanish and it'll tell you

exactly when from that time that it says

not what you're seeing but from that

hour it says when the Sun sets wait 45

minutes after that at least don't leave

after half an hour because there's still

chances I've seen it you still see it

very well then

southern this Friday we shall see the

moon and when the Shabbat begins we

shall begin to live the fourth month

which bears the infamous name of famous

Tamez is a Babylonian God obviously but

not need for you to blush don't make a

big deal out of it I like to call it the

fourth month in Septimus but don't break

your head over it because every day of

the week every day of our calendar is a

Roman or Greek god so then what is

problem they're all gods here they're

all gods absolutely all pagan god so

then monk got extra one got less that we

may have on the calendar but tell the

truth

Tammis is just a name of reference let's

call it the fourth month I like it more

so as to not be Saint Amos but as the

reference we also know that it is called

Thomas or the fourth month so then it

begins on next a Shabbat very well then

proverbs 25:2 will is read it it is the

glory of Elohim to conceal the word it

is the honor of the King to search out

the word so then häôs the word it is

sealed worship as we've been studying

throughout many Shabbats has a direct

relation with the sexual act with Elohim

that's how he sees it he declares itself

and that's how we accept that period if

we worship another god

he says you have been sexual relations

with another God you are changing me for

another God and you're fornicating with

another god so then he has directly that

connotation and today we have I put up

the Sun in a different way which says

scheme' Israel Yahweh Elohim no Yahweh

hey HUD and on the other side as I've

showed you

you've got the flat earth which was made

by our Creator there we have it I wasn't

drinking coffee the cup is empty today

it is only there so as to have the Shema

present for you not to forget so I am

don't forget so no one forgets the Shema

that is the Shema yes is that being

pronounced from some sort of other

language or does it come straight from

hey babe

well that's the way it's pronounced in

Hebrew Aloha noon and oh hey no now in

your home state they might pronounce a

little different just like we've heard

to parents other things at least let's

start to imitate how it's said

originally but is it a transliteration

that's the way it is written but the

sound is aloha new

all right if I say LaHaye new whatever

Jewish person that doesn't speak English

understands me perfectly well that is a

real Hebrew pronunciation Eloheinu hello

hey new alright if i recite the shabbat

to whomever speaks hebrew they'll get it

do you understand me perfectly well now

he won't accept it because I'm saying

Yahweh they say Hashem or I deny in any

case after the Arab say that's what they

got upset that's why they get upset if

your goal is to really upset one of them

and make them mansion yahwah if you want

to get him violent say Yahweh and in his

mind and that's if he doesn't say

anything to you in his mind he'll say

what a blasphemous Christian [ __ ] what a

blasphemous God you'll say what a [ __ ]

these desert to be sent to if only I

could

I would make your sacrifice of Pesa or

poutine because of being so blasphemous

so blasphemous so for them you have to

say I don't know you have to say make

sure you don't only live

shema yisrael adonai eloheynu

I had that's the way they say it if you

recite it that way they will greet you

warmly if you say Yahweh that's when it

all hits the fan they won't say hello

exactly no right there they're gonna see

you as an enemy and be like what an

ignorant goat so ignorant Eastern learn

Hebrew and on top of it all he

transgresses it because for them it is

to transgress just like to transgress

Shabbat mind you it is very very it is

very important not to mention the name

of Elohim for them that's the way they

are taught do I blame them no I don't

blame these people cuz that's the way

they were taught but there's also blame

on them for not reading the Torah that

precisely is that we have to mention

Yahweh absolutely absolutely

yes they see you as being inferior from

the moment in which you don't practice

the Jewish

religion now if you practice the Jewish

religion or whatever your color is they

see as equal there's not a problem of

racism there is a problem ideologies

with them if whatever person from

whatever color skin black white or

whatever but you become Jewish they look

at you as an equal the thing is when you

don't worship what they worship ok

understand that that's the way it is

very well then intellectually understand

truth like they see it and we not having

the intellectual capacity

yes but exactly that's how they look at

you if you do not practice their

religion according to their standards

according to their Talmud and all that

but if you go to them and you tell them

I want to become a Jew then they accept

you so you're a foreigner they no longer

see you as a foreigner if you practice

that they see you as an equal

maybe there is a difference among them

because maybe you don't look like them

or whatever but if you notice in Israel

there's all races if they practice

Judaism they accept you very well then

it is not it is not by chance not by

chance we're talking about Germania as

the land of the devil it is not by

chance that the Eskenazi Jews because as

Knaus is also Germany so then if you see

that the Jews the majority of them who

hear it what cutoff it says fatal error

remember what I'm saying

fatal error Paltalk messenger stopped

working can you hear me well and the

other means

okay I believe it's all back online so

then I was talking about a Skinner's

right Jeremy Eskenazi

Ferelden so then the ashkenazi

supposedly refuge themselves in a place

that is called a scanners which later

was known as Germany but it's always

been a part of Germania and that's where

we get the whole rest of the Ashkenazi

Jews it is the same race the same race

of the Anglos the same race of the u.s.

the same race of the Ashkenazi neither

of them do I consider to be original

Hebrew except for the Sephardic they are

the only ones supposedly direct from the

direct lineage of what was left from the

Jews so then the Ashkenazi for me are

people of the same race of England's the

same race of the u.s. who claim to be

Jews were brought up as Jews they speak

Hebrew but they're not really Jewish but

that would not matter whether they are

or not what matters is that what they

practice is not the true religion but

the false one so then even if they were

actual Jews practicing a false religion

it is of no avail to them so then they

are false

that's why Israel is Babylon and has

been governed by Babylon ever since they

became a nation in 1948 Ferelden Isaiah

46 8 through 13

the Spanish martini - version remember

this and understand it well come into

raisin ye sinners remember the former

things of old that I am Elohim and now

other Elohim exists and none is like

unto me declaring the end from the

beginning and from ancient times the

things that are not yet done I say and

my decision is carried out and

everything that I please I do

from the east I'll call the Eagle the

man that executed my counsel from a far

country I say as I do it as I plan it I

also do it

hearken unto me ye step hearted that are

far from righteousness I bring near my

righteousness it is not far off and my

salvation shall not tarry and I will

play salvation in Zion and my glory unto

Israel we've been reading these texts

every time we are or every time we

presented these studies of Shabbat to

make it very clear so that the mind

never forgets that the first thing that

Yahweh taught his people is that there's

one alone all the information that comes

afterward in the propitious order we

must understand it based on what yahwah

taught his people there's only one

Elohim so then as a base when a people

was being formed when the people of

Israel was being formed they were given

the base the EMU Vil base all the

information that he will give his people

later must be accommodated to that base

that's why he says remember this and

understand it well enter into reason ye

sinners today will read a couple new

texts the one that I told you last

repent that was long we'll read it today

first we'll read 2nd Kings 19 14 through

15 I'll read from the Spanish DHH the

second book of Kings 19 14 through 15

Hezekiah who was Hezekiah he was a king

of Israel Hezekiah received the letter

of the hand of the messengers after

having read it he went up to the house

of yahweh so then he was from judah king

of judah nat king of israel i'm

referring to his role as united kingdom

but they weren't

United king of Judah he went up to the

house of Yahweh and spread it before

Yahweh then Hezekiah prayed before

Yahweh same yahweh elohim of israel who

it's dwellest between the cherubims only

thou art elohim of all the kingdoms of

the earth

how many a lame are there just the one

just one

thou not ye but thou hast made heaven

and earth let's go to the same story but

this time I'd like to read a lot more

let us go to Isaiah 37:14 338 and I

shall read from the Spanish version the

book of the people of God Isaiah 37 14

through 38 so that you see the entire

context of the story there are many

things that we could learn from here

Hezekiah received the letter from the

hand of the messengers and read it see

the thing is that there were threats

that Assyria was coming and that they

were going to completely destroy Judah

that's why they were terrified the

wounds there and the king went directly

to ask of Yahweh that he defend him

Hezekiah received a letter from the hand

of the messengers and read it and then

went up into the house of Yahweh and

spread it before Yahweh and Hezekiah

prayed until I was saying Yahweh of

hosts elohim of israel that dwellest

between the cherubims thou art elohim

even thou alone of all the kings of the

earth thou hast made heaven and earth it

is exactly the way it is written in

second Kings incline thine ear Yahweh in

here open thine eyes o Yahweh and see

and hear all the words that Seneca Reeb

had sent to say to insult the living

eloheem it is true o Yahweh

that the kings of Assyria have laid

waste all the nations and their

territories they have cast their gods

into the fire the gods of the kingdoms

that they were conquering for they were

no gods but the work of man's hands and

no more no more than wooden stone

therefore they have destroyed them so

then the pagan nations the pagan nations

would conquer other kingdoms and since

they would conquer those kingdoms they

would grab the gods of those kingdoms

and destroy them demonstrating they were

false because the true ones according to

them were the gods who have made them

win the war so then what happens if they

would come and conquer is rather it said

o God of Israel is no good that's the

logic that Hezekiah

is applying here now therefore Yahweh

our Elohim save us from his hand that

all the kingdoms of the earth may know

that thou alone

oh yah we are telling that's the logic

he presents Elohim with because he's not

asking for the people but for eloheem

for his name if they conquer and destroy

us then you will pass over to the

nonexistence even if your truth they'll

call you a false god that's it it's over

so then Hezekiah presents elohim with

logic and works a bit of psychology on

elohim he tells them don't let them

conquer us so that only you alone are

left as an only eloheem which you are

and only eloheem and that's perfect why

am I reading this because it is clear

that yahwah acts based on this petition

yahwah receives the worship from

Hezekiah listens to Hezekiah petition

and understands what is the kiya is

talking about 21 then Isaiah the son of

Amoz

sentient Hezekiah saying thus saith

yahweh elohim of israel thou has prayed

to me yah was saying that to his Akaya

through isaiah thou hast prayed to me

against Seneca rib king of Assyria

there's the word which Yahweh had spoken

concerning him she hath despised thee

and left thee to score

the Virgin the daughter of Zion behind

your back the daughter of Jerusalem had

shaken her head at thee whom has thou

reproached and bless fiend and against

whom has the exalted thy voice and

lifted up thine eyes on high even

against the kadosh it's his holy just

understand what the word holy is which

is actually Kadosh the Kadosh One of

Israel by thy servants has thou insulted

Yahweh and has said with the multitude

of my teary 'its and might come up to

the height of the mountains to the sites

of Lebanon and it will cut down the tall

Cedars thereof and the choice fir trees

thereof and it will enter into the

height of his border and the forest of

his Carmel I have digged in drunk water

and with the sole of my feet have I

dried up all the rivers of the besieged

places that's precisely what's being

said by Seneca River the king of Assyria

and here yahweh responds to Seneca Reem

I love this dialogue hast thou not heard

long ago that I've prepared it I have

planned it from ancient times and now I

bring it to pass what does how well is

do he plans it from long ago since a

better sheet and now he brings it to

pass that thou should ask me to lay

waste defense cities what y'all was

saying is that everything you did I

actually did it I sent you to do it that

is what y'all was telling him how

terrible is it to understand that it is

not one strength

well terrible for someone who's proud

like Seneca did who thinks that he's got

his power that his gods give him the

victory and that he is a work of his own

hands and for the turtle him to come and

say I had you do all that you're a

puppet of mine

that's the worst insult

could be which is not an insult as a

truth

the problem is accepting it now the

thing is that that guy can't be judged

thenar main because he followed orders

even if they were evil they were against

him that's regularly the way I see it

they were against him either way he can

be touched because he did it he did it

it's character cuz I was his character

exactly there are many aspects there see

it's not the point right there that's

not exactly the point

exactly I'm saying don't you worry about

that he'll be just the justice okay

he'll be judged the justice I'll read

this text of the New Living Translation

Isaiah 37:26 says but have you not heard

I decided this long ago long ago I

planned it and now I am making it happen

I planned for a you to crush fortified

cities and reduced him down to rubble

here in this version I clearly read it

to you that you understand that y'all

was Tung Seneca Abe that he is a puppet

of his plant from long ago 27 that is

why their people have so little power

and are so frightened and confused they

are as weak as grass as easily trembled

us tender green shoots they are like

grass sprouting on housetops scorched

before it can grow lush and tall but I

know when you sit down look up what he

tells them this would seem to be the new

world order telling us Zionism and the

new world order the Illuminati which

allow the same thing that's we want to

control us they watch us and listen to

us everywhere but Elohim does watch and

listen to everyone he sound this to

Seneca tin but I know when you sit down

when you go out and when you come in and

when you rage against me because thy

rage is against me that right there was

not planned by a line Armando he can be

judged for that the owest

blaming him for something he's blaming

him for something he didn't command him

to do well yeah we had him do that's fun

but if there are things do you remember

in the Book of Enoch where the pastors

would kill more sheep than what was

allowed to them it's give or take the

same thing so then it says yahwah tells

them I know it all I know what you do

what you're thinking when you have rage

when you get up when you go out when you

come in when you lay down I know

everything about you because thy rage

has been against me and your insolence

has come up into mine ears you see

therefore will I put my hook in thy nose

that's not because he was obedient but

rather because of exalting himself

against Yahweh so then it says I will

put my hook in thine oath and my Brill

and thy lips and I will turn the back by

the way by who it thou camest I'll read

from the New Living Translation Isaiah

37-28 through 29 it reads as follows but

you are Noel I know where you stay and

when you come and go I know the way you

have raged against me and because of

your raging against me and your

arrogance which I have heard for myself

will I put my hook in your nose and my

bit in your mouth I will make you return

by the same road on which you came do

you see now which was the problem of

this King problem of this King was that

his rage was against Yahweh

his attitude Ferelden 30 and this shall

be a sign unto thee this year ye shall

eat of the fallen grain in the second

year that which spring it forth of the

same but in the third year so ye in reap

plant vineyards and eat the fruit

thereof it is very interesting because

right there he stops talking he stops

talking to Seneca rib directly yah

no longer talks to Santa curbs messages

ended in a yaw wid through Isaiah talks

to the king he talks to Zedekiah that is

when the message changes I tell you so

you understand

Telly's understand not Zedekiah but

rather Hezekiah Hezekiah that's when he

talks to Hezekiah the King say

understand that yahwah no longer speaks

to cenek rib but is now speaking to

Hezekiah very well then and he tells

them don't you worry he will not touch

you he might make a big ruckus but I'll

send them back the way he came I'll go

ahead and read this and that knee Living

Translation Isaiah 3730

here they added so as to not have any

confusion they went ahead and added

office then Isaiah said to Hezekiah they

totally added that but it's just so they

understand that I switched from talking

to the other King and then now he's

speaking to the king of Judah then

Isaiah said to Hezekiah this is the

proof that what I say is true this year

you will eat only what grows up by

itself and next year you will eat what

springs up from that yet in the third

year you will plant crops and harvest

them you will tend vineyards any thereof

it would seem as if it is very similar

to that which would happen during

Jubilee and that sir if this was a

Jubilee but that doesn't matter but it

would seem that it was exactly the same

thing that would happen during a Jubilee

31 the survivors from the house of Judah

those who still remain shall again take

route downward and bear fruit upward so

as to better understand it let's read it

in the Loom translation and you who are

left in Judah those survivors who have

escaped the ravages of the siege will

put roots down in your own soil and grow

up and flourish so then the survivors

will grow and prosper 30

four out of Jerusalem shall go forth a

remnant and out of the bent of Zion some

survivors the zeal of Yahweh of hosts

shall do this therefore thus saith

Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria

I'm about to continue reading but what

my reading of these texts well first of

all and mainly so as to show that yahwah

responded to the prayer in which he was

told you're the only old hymn that

exists that's where yeah we responded

and he did so in a way that was

impressive which we're about to read

later but also this is a prophecy this

really took place but it is also a

prophecy because we're in the same

situation now Assyria who is Babylon has

Judah surrounded which are the last

righteous people on earth they are

enslaved and those who survive that

they're the ones for whom precisely this

promises for which says they will again

take root and will have their own soil

they will grow and prosper that very

same prophecy which took place there has

a dual fulfillment because it will take

place with us as well we're in the same

situation Seneca Reeb which is now all

of Babylon has a surrounded has is

enslaved we are the last ones understand

the message there is only a few those

who survive the attack because Yahweh

will defend us those who are V elect who

survived the attack those who are left

the elect are the only ones that will

again take root and prosper and flourish

that is the second reason of why I read

this text okay then 33 therefore thus

saith Yahweh concerning the king of

Assyria Babylon he shall not come into

this city nor shut an arrow there nor

come before it with shields nor cast a

bank against it by the way that he came

by the same shall he return and shall

not come into the city saith Yahweh for

I will defend

city to save it for my own sake and for

my servant David's sake that is very

important because it is the very same

thing exact the same thing that we wait

for him to do with no great duration

begin for Yahweh to be a defender that

Yahweh be our keeper and that because of

his honor

none of his elect children will perish

we are the remnant that are left of

survivors 36 the angel of Yahweh which

could be Yahweh himself or an angel of

Yahweh there are many situations in

which sometimes the angel of Yahweh

Yahweh himself and sometimes that angel

Yahweh is an angel of Yahweh so then we

never really know the intro of Yahweh

went forth and smote in the camp of the

Assyrians a hundred and four score and

five thousand in once although he

annihilated that smiting means he killed

a hundred and eighty five thousand men

just one angel and when the rest arose

early in the morning they saw that they

were all dead corpses then say- king of

Assyria lifted up the camp departed and

returned and stayed in Nineveh that is

how yahwah defense when human strength

is no longer enough yahweh intervenes in

here annihilate a hundred and eighty

five thousand men do you have any idea

how much under any five thousand men are

at once laid waste in a city because

they were surrounding Jerusalem laying

around the Jews themselves had to bury

them because the rest left a hundred

eighty-five thousand that's a huge

quantity but now it'll be more either

forget it Millions

now there will be millions millions

exactly one day as he was worshiping in

the house of knees broke that

King Sennacherib the story's not done

yet his God

nice Rock his God nice Rock

what a weird name right nice rock sounds

like all types of things that a drama

like in Sarah's air his sons his own

sons smote him with the sword so then

the guy was worshiping his God and his

own sons came and killed with the sword

and they escaped into the land of

Armenia and these are had done I mean I

don't know the exact original

pronunciation but it could be as our

haedong or as our hayden his son reigned

in his stead and that's where the star

said i could have ended he tried to

conquer Jerusalem the King Hezekiah

prayed unto Yahweh and said you are our

only eloheem you are the only real

eloheem in the world to demonstrate that

you're the only eloheem of the world and

the real eloheem of the world came and

killed 185 thousand men and then ended

up killing the very same king who had

raged against him farewell then we shall

continue study other texts that speak

about there being only one elohim

farewell then they asked me about this

text i know you have doubts about this

text i've already explained it I believe

that I've explained it I don't remember

well but I think I've already explained

it but now I shall detail the

explanation of this text I used to use

this text very often brutally to explain

there were two beings it is one of those

key texts of the eternal truth John 3:16

was one of them this is the other one of

the two and then later in the next in

the next chapter will study proverbs 9

as well proverbs 8 I mean but won't

study it today well also be studying

Psalms 2 but not today it'll be later

but this text that is in the invitation

is proverbs 30 verse 4 which reads as

follows will ascend it to heaven and

descend it

who enclosed the winds and his fists who

trapped the waters in a piece of cloth

who established all beings of the earth

what is his name in the name of his son

if you know this is one of the most

important texts to say that they are -

what is his name in the name of his son

if you know the tourism at says as

follows who hath ascended up into heaven

or descended so as to speak wisely who

hath bound the wind in his fists who

hath bound in dense clouds the waters as

in a garment who hath given this

capability to other parts of the earth

what is his name of him who did it and

what is the name of his son declare it

thou if I can't tell with this text I

repeat we used to say see there -

there's not three here there's one and

his son now before I begin explaining

this before I begin explaining this this

is a very difficult text the entire

chapter is difficult so as to have a

greater context of what the Jewish wise

men say I read many commentaries to see

how they see this text what if because I

want to see their point of view what did

they see in this text what's interesting

is that I can communicate unto you that

they see it in a way that is pretty

correct other wise men not as correct

but the one seeing it in

correct are we were we cuz now I shall

explain it clearly the way it is

absolutely the way it is there is no

other explanation possible telling you

right now there isn't don't look because

there isn't the way we had it it was

misapplied from the get-go here it's not

talking about Elohim father and eloheem

the son of course not it is not talking

about two Elohim absolutely not what is

he talking about well the first and main

reason of what he's speaking about we

have to initiate the reading from verse

one

I'll read it from the Spanish simple

language version kizlet of all of them

it was the one I liked the most the way

they captured the text you can read it

in any version will say the same thing

but this one you understand it it's not

that has something different now it's

the same thing that it is understood a

little better with the words proverbs 30

begin saying these are the words of a

gur son of haka from massa there we

start off not wrong but kind of weird

because we know that proverbs was

written by Solomon but now what he's

gonna quote in Proverbs 30 was not

written by Solomon

it's as if Solomon is quoting Solomon

who wrote proverbs said Solomon said

these are the words of a gur son of

Hackett from maza now who in the world

is a Gor let's start there who is a girl

among the Jews the opinion is divided

some say something which I find

completely equivocal that by our gur

solemn is referring to himself when with

another name so as to demonstrate that

he was really ignorant I don't find that

feasible in any way ever no sense at all

now the majority say that agar was one

of the instructors of Solomon that

Solomon obviously was the wisest men on

earth but a wise man surrounds himself

with wise people that they advise him so

then one of the wisest advisors of

Solomon that's what happens in order to

be the wisest of them all he must have

wise counselors but the wise men says

what do you say what do you say what do

you say what do you say and he chooses

the best opinion of them all so then one

of the counselors of Solomon whose name

was augur told something to Solomon and

Solomon loved what he told him so then

he said this was said by a girl by

Councillor he could have added then we

start to understand who a ger is agar is

not a prophet agar is apparently one of

the counselors of Solomon son of hawk

ephraim aza agar spake unto I feel and

do call in the following matter so then

Solomon is about to relate something

that he heard a girl say - I feel and do

call what did our ger say I am the most

ignorant man among the brutish and have

not the understanding of a man I neither

learnt wisdom and much less true

knowledge of who Elohim is there we

start see the things are weird because

of the one who's gonna declare something

to you whether you know the father and

the son or the name of the father and

the father of the son before that he

warns you that he's the most ignorant of

all he for wound you that he has no

understanding of men

he also forewarned you that he has no

wisdom nor the knowledge of who Elohim

is so then what should we listen to the

guy I'm about to give you my opinion but

he's saying I don't know a thing about

anything I am the most ignorant man

among all ignorant men I know not Elohim

and then immediately after he says no

one has ascended to heaven do you see

the continuity there I cannot just take

this text and

isolated the text continues to say I'll

repeat I'm the most ignorant of all I

never gained any true knowledge all I

have is false knowledge I'm filled with

false knowledge out of all the ignorant

men I'm the most brutish of them all I

have not the capacity of reason I have

no wisdom no one hath ascended to heaven

from heaven no one had descended there

is no one that can retain the wind and

his fists no wrap-up the sea in a

garment no one knows who established the

ends of the earth no one knows him

neither knows who his son is that's

interesting right starts to sound

differently that way right because if I

take verse 4 and I take it as a truth

from a wise men telling me do you know

this now the guy's telling you there's

no thing about anything he says no one

here knows anything I am ignorant I

don't know anything so then who's gonna

know anything said them first of all the

first thing I've got to do is not to

take this text the way we took it before

as a declaration of supreme wisdom when

it doesn't have any wisdom when the guy

says I'm extremely ignorant for I don't

know a thing no one went to have a no

one came down from heaven no one did

anything here so then I don't know a

thing neither do you he's telling you

neither I nor you so what is the message

of this text does this text say that

there to love him no no no no this text

is marvelous I'm about to explain why is

it marvelous because we've got to

understand it from a different point of

view that we've never seen before the

guy saying this I consider him to be

very wise I'm about to explain we're

missing some oil there before it dries

out the guy who said that it was very

wise what did I say a girl very wise

he's gonna make a point he's gonna make

a point and he wants to highlight it in

a way that is special you'll get it when

I demonstrate it in other words this

phrase can only be said by somebody very

wise

the way of placing the words do you

follow I'm about to explain it because

sometimes we don't get to actually grasp

things unless they are extreme and

drastic I like things to be drastic and

extreme but the way this guy put it the

way of writing is rather phenomenal and

I find the guy to be very wise Wow

extremely wise what does this text try

to say what this text is trying to say

is as follows this text about what is

said by a girl son of hockey it means

this that when we are born into the

world we are more than ignorant all the

knowledge that we say we have is false

knowledge because it was given to us by

men our fathers exactly our fathers

exactly out of the ignorant man we're

the most ignorant we have not gone up

into heaven to see anything above nor

did we descend from heaven no angel came

to tell us anything

exactly much less from the third heaven

so then since we don't know anything

about anything we also cannot find out

the origins of the earth nor anything

that has to do with this creation

through investigation nor observation

that is what he's saying so then if

someone who has no type of knowledge of

the Torah only by investigating nature

its laws than all the rest is he gonna

find eloheem he's not gonna find a lame

he'll never find him and if he's not

gonna find Allah heme is he gonna find

the form in which he'll he made the

earth it is impossible el he made this

earth in six days science says that

that's impossible

modern science is that this took

millions of years in forming itself that

everything that we see took millions of

years to evolve and what we see in six

days they say it's impossible but now if

we put that fall

science aside and we without any

knowledge of the torah' we want to find

out who the Creator is and now it may be

earth could we know it we could not know

it so then he precisely agar is making

that point all right again it says as

follows so that you understand it now

from that point of view these are the

words of agar the son of haka from aza

agar spoke to I feel in you call in the

following manner

Solomon loved this so much that he

included it surely I am more brutish

than any man we're all included there

and have not the understanding of a men

what capacity of reasoning do we have if

we cannot deduct who the earth was made

by tell me none absolutely none in other

words with my reasoning can I arrive at

understand Darryl he made the earth in

six days tell me no absolutely not

I have no wisdom obviously and much less

knowledge of who Elohim is no one hath

ascended up to heaven from heaven no one

has descended there's no one that can

retain the wind in his fists nor bind

the waters in a garment no one knows who

established the ends of the earth no one

knows him nor knows who his son is so

then what is the entire point of all

this it is very clear and I'm about to

say it but you had to read the following

text the very following text you've

still got to read the next text proverbs

35 and 6 I'll read from the Jerusalem

2001 every word of Elohim is guaranteed

he is our shield unto us who trust in

him at Val not unto his words lest he

reprove thee and thou be found a liar

this the entire message of agar who

first said that all of us men are

ignorant that we have not the capacity

of discovering anything by ourselves we

have that capacity of reasoning we have

met understanding

nurture knowledge we cannot go up into

heaven we have met the physical strength

to grab wind or anything southern the

only thing in which we can depend on is

the truck is talking about the Torah he

is giving the entire valley of the

knowledge that we could have in the

truck and that is precisely the central

message I read in the New Living

Translation proverbs 35 through six New

Living Translation every word of Elohim

proves to be true he is a shield to all

who come to him for protection do not

add to his words or he may rebuke you

and expose you as a liar so then the

central message is that the scriptures

which we note that the scriptures are

contaminated with man's words but when

we start to deeply read into it with

discover the true scriptures which is

our only guide in this world if we

remove this the scripture basically the

Torah we take it out we take out all the

knowledge there is so what he's saying

is that everything revolves around the

table without Torah you don't even know

who the Creator is nor how he made the

earth you're one of the most ignorant

men because you'll never go up to heaven

and no one's gonna come down from having

to tell you anything so then we're the

most privileged in having the table the

most privileged that's why when new

prophets come like Paul tarses LG white

with a message contradictory to the

Torah that is when we have to decide

what is most important do we stay with

them who fed from the Torah or do we go

to the only thing we have which is the

Torah the only thing that we have is the

Torah and of the prophets that built

with the Torah as a base if they have

not the car as a base then they are not

true

because they're not building upon the

only base we have there's no other base

in fact if your show would come and

contradict the Torah he would not be a

true mashiac he wouldn't be because

everything has to be based in the trough

if we have not the trough we do not know

how the earth is made we don't know how

there's no way to find out not

scientifically nor empirically not even

with our false reasoning I'll call it

false because our reasoning is very

lying very deceitful so then there's no

way for us to find out how the earth was

made there's no way that is why modern

science says rubbish why don't they say

rubbish because they don't believe in

the Torah and if they don't believe in

the trout what do they believe in

nothing but rubbish so then it is all a

lie except for the trough and whatever

is built based on the table

so then is that clear is it clear why

agar is so wise to say those things what

he's saying is there's no speech is to

say that the only thing that we can

understand it know is the trial I mean

it is absolutely clear right of why this

is the most ignorant fool the only thing

because then he says every word of

Yahweh he's referring to the trough

every word of Yahweh proves true of

course it's referring to the pure Torah

not everything that they have added

another rest but we do have the pure

word of Elohim here if we take out the

lies obviously if we eliminate this we

eliminate every true knowledge nothing

we don't have anything left absolutely

nothing there is no profit on this earth

that can replace the Torah nothing there

isn't anything for for profit Rises

that's as I come with the message of

elohim of god and rejects the torah he

cannot be true he cannot be true not

true at all that is why now you remember

how exactly but now i say to you exactly

exactly that is why we see the instance

when since the Thar since better sheets

in the truck it is all written in the

truck we're in the last times where

times of destruction we may already be

living the Great Tribulation today but

we still don't know we have to let some

time go by in order to see whether these

destructions will start to accumulate

until they get to their climax we do not

know or it could begin next year I'm not

gonna explain that today but I'll do so

at another time but we have to live day

by day

with very wide-open eyes because we are

in times of destruction that is what

we're living in we don't have to wait

for anything else anymore we're in time

of destruction it is all fulfilled

whenever Elohim gets the urge just like

in one night he killed 185,000 you could

kill 3 4 5 million people so as to

initiate something pretty strong so then

when on the field in the camp of Seneca

deep that night they were all doing all

right right they went to sleep kick back

and 185,000 were found dead there their

pattern with battle proud exactly so

then we are now in times of destruction

I cannot assure you neither can I nor

can you for we have not gone up to

heaven nor come back from there I can

assure when it'll begin but what I can

assure you is that we're in the proper

time for it to begin it could be this

evening tomorrow or it could also begin

next year I'll later on explain for what

reason in there what logic within as

much logic that could be had because

we've already seen that there is no

logic no capacity of reasoning no

nothing so then the best way of

reasoning properly which is it Latura

and if the Trier indicates you see that

is why in this ministry we have

attempted Vance tin one direction but we

have gone back on that direction the

base is the trough the food of course

raw food is good the geezers are

spectacular they're good but from that

to say that to eat meat is a sin that in

itself is a sin to say that it's a sin

that is absolutely a sin you see to say

that to eat meat is a sin just like

Ellen White said as I was reading this

week some quotes of hers let's say that

to eat me

what were the words she used that to eat

meat perturbs that's not the word goes

doves yes that's the word that's the way

it was translated does the spiritual

faculties and mental ones so then if I

eat meat I cannot understand spiritual

things said LNG white but then how was

it understood by Abraham who ate mostly

meat how are they understood by the

disciples how did you show himself

understand it in all cases

he gave them meat to eat so then he

expected know what into them same thing

Ellen White said nuttin but insanity

just like that insanity that's why at

that time during that stage of the

Ministry of the atomic Ruth for some

reason which I consider that was

inspired by Yahweh on us to make a

change in our diet but that change is

great because it is kind of like

medicine it doesn't mean that that's our

diet it is a medicine throughout all of

our bad diet that we had but the trough

not only the Torah not only does it not

deny meat consumption but rather the

Torah encourages the consumption of meat

clean meats clean meats but imagine the

Hebrews the Israelites don't look at it

with your Babylonian mind you have now

because if you gone out to the store you

find lettuce of all types not just

lettuce but all kinds of lettuce all

kinds of tomatoes all kinds of onions

celery regular organic packaged more

expensively for cheaper an entire

department of produce kept cool

preserving the vegetables from going bad

so soon all arranged nicely and pretty

accessible in the price so that you go

and choose whatever you'd like to eat

and fruits fruit that doesn't even exist

in your region not in a hundred miles

do you have peaches of all kinds fuzzy

or shiny got apricots all types of fruit

like that mangoes lots of different

kinds whatever you want to pay for none

of which grows in your ghetto fruit that

is flown in from other countries or in

ships or whatever

here are the plums we eat in the peaches

say they come from Chile in Chile is not

next door is not Chile Street it's from

Chile other weird fruit comes from

Indonesia those huge ones

exactly almost all the fruit or rather

the vegetables come from Mexico southern

now do not look at our diet like before

before an Israelite you an Israelite you

had to find a way with whatever he had

at hand it's always been that way the

supermarket's with cold produce have not

always been around everything preserved

bringing you things from thousands of

miles away no no no in fact you would

eat the vegetables and the fruit from

the season

how would you feed yourself because not

the vegetarians tell you and also the

vegans who are detestable by the way

just like that on top of we never using

their name now I even see the vegans is

detestable from the moment in which they

say our brethren the animals the animals

are not a brethren they really are the

brothers the animals because they're

animals but I want to leave that

declared the eternal truth is not vegan

the eternal truth is that a sister of

the animals the animals are not our kin

whatsoever animals do not descend from

humans nor do we descend from animals

we've never been brothers to the animals

there are a completely different race

inferior and have nothing to do with us

so then don't you ever call an animal

your brother don't be because if you

call an animal your brother starting

with the word brother but I don't care

right now that's the sense that the

world understands if you call an animal

your brother so then I'm gonna call you

an animal there's another way about it

you're an animal are you a brother of

the wolves then you're a wolf of Revan

one at that exactly because there's a

lot who have now gotten into the whole

Indian thing and have now sided with the

Indians defending great chief starving

Lauren horse or whatever they want to

call themselves whatever they want to

call themselves and I detest all of that

listen well from my lips I detest the

defense of the Indians I detest the

defense of the animals I detest all of

that because doesn't go with Allah James

message if you identify with the Native

Americans to go with them and toss the

tour aside doesn't talk about them that

route does not talk about Native

Americans listen law talks about Elohim

who created a people and that people is

Israel and if you want to go with the

Native Americans then go with them

already but get off our backs already

about them go with them you're not of

the eternal truth here they're still one

the defense a Native American or their

tribes the only tribe that I defend are

the twelve tribes of Israel never gonna

call us Indians that's fine that's fine

in our chieftain is Yeshua HaMashiach

Yahweh now the rest of the Indians it's

all Babylon I don't care if their name

is the tired horse the starving horse

the wolf my brother our hearts and

repose right a horse and repose it

doesn't matter what they're called I

care less exactly the only tribal folk a

proof by Yahweh are the twelve tribes of

Israel mentioned in Revelation any other

tribes a third to the lake of fire or at

least stand by to be judged but we are

not the animals brothers is that clear

much life of the monkey much less of the

monkey or any of the animals now so as

to not miss out on what I'm saying which

is very important as Israelites as

Israel at that time there was no

supermarkets as the ones I mentioned now

what would people feed on so as to live

to 70 years 80 years and to live well

what would they feed on on meat on meat

there's no way you would drop you

imagine an Israelite back in Israel

times with a little bit of potatoes and

that's if there was any that existed

with a couple cucumbers I mean I'm just

mentioning the vegetables which are

mentioned in the Torah and the Bible

just mentioning those I asked you can a

human survive on that no no he cannot

because weed kills you tell your front

wheat kills you rice there wasn't any it

also kills you it doesn't offer much at

least corn that's if there was corn some

people say there wasn't I believe that

maybe there was a type of corn there was

it also doesn't serve me much you need

to eat protein where would they get

protein wheat protein is incomplete and

it comes with more problems than

anything else

it inflammations than anything else that

it has to offer the least it has is the

protein you need where would Israel get

their protein from don't be stubborn

they would get it from the meat there

was no other source that's well him gave

it because it is that even if you don't

believe it

it is the complete perfect food for

human beings there's no errors like they

would not eat meat so then for us to say

no we shouldn't eat meat because it is a

sin it is actually complete foolishness

to say that foolishness right because

now you've got a supermarket you go and

choose all the fruit you want when you

say I have a balanced diet why balanced

because they bring me from Brazil from

Chile from Indonesia from Japan from

Mexico and there's a whole lot of slaves

that bring them to me so I can buy it

and when you don't have that what are

you gonna eat what are you gonna eat

when you don't have that if you have in

your mind that to eat meat is a sin then

you're gonna start to death or when you

do eat it you'll feel like a sinner but

meat it is medicine to eat and on top of

it not being a sin to eat it yah Wade

gave it as a privilege as a special food

for Israel I want you to understand it

the cows the sheep and the goats are not

our brethren yahwah gave them to feed

the people i want to make that clear now

the fact that I've said before something

different that matter where it said

before it was the stage we were going

through but Yahweh fed any designed the

animal for it to be eaten

whether you like it or not you listen to

me I could care less the trial says that

if you're against the Torah and you want

to be a vegan

then it is a time for you to go in a

different direction they just passed me

a quote from LMG wait I mean she's got a

whole lot Ellen is like the intellectual

moral and physical powers are

depreciated by the habitual use of flesh

meats meat eating arranges the system

she continues be clouds the intellect

and blunts the moral sensibilities the

safest course for you is to let meat

alone your safest course is to let Ellen

White alone that is the safest for today

that is the safest for today to leave

that crazy old hag and her tips no one

else you see is not one UN's

not one ounce should enter stomachs

exactly that was the problem

with this lady okay then that's why I

tell you when we are we're in the trough

we're based in the draw that's what the

toys

didn't ask me what my advice is I don't

advise because to advise is to add unto

the Torah no I've already told you that

if you're sick other fruit juices skin

treat you how a diet that's rich in raw

food how it helps your system I've

already told you that but you've got to

know how to choose and if you pretend to

be judges then you should be judging

what you eat that's it that's it at this

point in time you eat what you see

propecia is for you which is allowed by

the drop if you have some type of

special needs then look to those special

needs look to those special needs as

I've already told you there's been cases

in the eternal truth that in surgeries

where it was needed for a quick growth

of the muscles the tendons the tissue

there's nothing in nature that'll help

you except for me nothing more meat and

me anything else and you won't heal and

you die it's just as simple as that to

them whatever is needed for your system

you're responsible for that you're the

judge you're the judge now if you're

eating unclean meats if you want a doll

fried foods which is what fried foods

and sugar is allowed in the trial but if

you eat sugar all day then you die from

diabetes that would be your own bad

judgment your own bad judgment you get

what I'm saying right okay the same

thing as with weight the same thing is

with rice the same thing is with corn if

you overdo it with those three products

and you get to the grave real quick and

if not to the grave then you get to the

hospital quick with lots of problems so

then use your judgement a good judgment

the topic is clear right and no one

judge his own lineage every one of you

has to be a judge every one of you must

be a judge of what you eat if I one day

go to LA and run into Danilo who's

feasting on a huge I don't know a subway

with turkey ham a 12-inch turkey sub I'm

not gonna tell him anything I'll tell me

you have good protein but nothing else

what I'm gonna I mean what what can I

tell him if I tell them that it's wrong

then I am a sinner because there isn't

wrong the Torah says that yahwah created

those animals for you to eat them period

so then do not criticize do not

criticize that is all the message that I

wanted to give you very well then

let's go back to proverbs 4 through

which says what is his name and his sons

name if you know is this talking about

Yahweh in the Sun no of course not

it is absolutely clear that it doesn't

it talks about Yahweh the only one there

is for Israel talks about Yahweh and it

talks about his son who is the son of

Yahweh who is it Israel

is very clear it is being said by an

Israelite he is saying that we do not

even know who the son of Yahweh is if it

wasn't because of the trial who tells us

or which was the first text that tells

us that Yahweh has a son called Israel

where is that filmed

I'm gonna read many texts but where is

it found mainly in the Torah in Exodus

it's gonna Exodus xers 422 through 23

Exodus 422 through 23

now before reading this text you might

say what is creased I'm talking about

the meat and all that I'm saying it

because in places like then as aware of

your where certain foods may be missing

that could compensate for not eating

meat if that bothers you a bit and

you've got a little more affection for

animals than the rest of us do not

hesitate to eat meat do not hesitate to

eat meat when you actually see that it's

propitious that's what I'm getting at

because maybe you're in Venezuela

Colombia or someplace where you cannot

even get all the foods that we have the

privilege of getting vegetables so then

if you're like you can get everything

over there and I'll get anything here

and all a deist potatoes and corn with

that you've got your death guaranteed

because you don't have the necessary

vitamins the protein you don't have

anything there you don't have anything

you'll have carbs there what do we do

with the rest that the body needs do not

have the very least bit of doubt of

eating meat you have to look for a

balance in your body okay that's all I'm

trying to teach here you know I said it

with this strength because also with the

same strength or even worse I said that

you have to be absolutely raw vegetarian

or vegetarian that this is left clear

and we recorded in our minds because

we've gone through stages has gone

through stages and now the truth is that

we weren't towards the raw in the Torah

tells us what we can eat and what we

cannot do period and you must be a judge

of what it is that you need very well

then Exodus for 20 through 23 this yah

was speaking speaking Moses and

shalt say unto Pharaoh thus saith Yahweh

Israel is my son even my firstborn

that's just my son but what the taught

declares who Yahweh's son is Israel is

my son even my firstborn and just in

case Pharaoh had any doubts look at what

Yahweh said and I say unto thee let my

son go not Israel but whom my son that

he may serve me and if thou refused to

let him go

behold I will slay thy son even thy

firstborn now Pharaoh son Egypt's

firstborn was it figurative or was it

real real the firstborn of every

Egyptian family their firstborn died but

that demonstrated that Israel was

actually the firstborn do you see that

it's not that it's figuratively that

Israel is the firstborn son and then

really I'm gonna kill your real son no

Yahweh said Israel is my firstborn not

figuratively I took him as a firstborn

he's my firstborn son and he's the

firstborn son of Yahweh Yahweh says I

will kill your firstborn son as real as

mine which is Israel up to all of them

even the firstborn of the cattle all of

it all of it died the interesting of

this is that yahwah declared who is the

son of Yahweh who is the firstborn of

Yahweh who is Israel this has to be left

absolutely clear the Torah is absolutely

clear that is why that is the only

reason why Yahweh killed Pharaohs

firstborn do you follow very well then

now let us go to Deuteronomy where stone

Torah Deuteronomy 14 and I only said

some there are many more there are many

more

he are the children of Yahweh your

Elohim what is Israel actual children

we're not talking about figurative

children ye are children of Yahweh your

Elohim ye shall not cut yourselves nor

make any baldness between your eyes for

the dead so then do not cut yourselves

nor shave your heads psalms 82:6 psalms

82:6 spanish DHH i said that you you are

israel he's speaking to israel i said

that you are gods or what are elohim i

said that your Elohim that your gods

that you're all sons of the Most High

so then if our Father is Elohim are the

children Elohim as well and it obviously

Elohim as well that is why you should

takes this and tells that Jews wasn't

that said that you're eloheem and the

scripture cannot be broken for our

fathers eloheem our father cannot have a

wolf I mean what is that if he takes us

as sons and we're actually like our

Father and that goes way past even that

we know that the man was made in the

image and likeness of Elohim but he

takes Israel says you're my firstborn

son at firstborn son Psalm 73 15 Psalms

73 15 if I had said I will speak like

them behold the generation of your

children I'd have deceived there's a

very good text you can read the context

I just brought this text to read that

the generation of your children are the

children of Yahweh that would be

deceived

it is absolutely clear that Israel is

the firstborn son of Yahweh

Hosea 11:1 I read in The Jerusalem 2001

how Zeya 11th one reads as follows when

Israel was a child I loved him and out

of Egypt I called my son out of this

scripture then they miss apply very

incorrectly and I've already explained

that but this for the newbs

they say that Yeshua as a child escaped

he went to Egypt and that from thence he

called his son from Egypt that the

Scriptures be fulfilled

no the scriptures were already fulfilled

you sure could never have gone to Egypt

I don't care if Matthew says that I

don't care who says it I can't remember

what book says it right now I don't care

what gospel says that it would had

violated the trough when Yahweh took his

people out of Egypt he says never go

back to Egypt not even to buy horses

don't go back to Egypt so then how is it

that Elohim is gonna go and hide in

Egypt it would violate his own words his

entourage without room for doubt so then

when we see these types of things we say

this could never be because Elohim

precisely told us never to go to Egypt

why is he gonna go to Egypt to hide

himself it makes no sense in fact all

the Israelites when Babylon came and

they went to hide in Egypt he killed

them all because he had told them do not

go to Egypt in all case he's got a

Babylon but not Egypt not Egypt so then

here this prophecy says when Israel was

a child I loved him and out of Egypt I

called my son it is not a platitude

Yeshua it could never be a pleasure sure

it is only applied to Israel and yahwah

says that israel is his son his son his

firstborn jeremiah 3:19 Jeremiah 3:19 is

Roel I decided to accept you as a son

and give you an enviable land the most

beautiful country in the world I thought

you would call me father and there you

would never turn from me so then in this

text yaaaaa says that it's as if he

adopted israel as a son adopted israel

as a son in that in adopting him as a

son he took him as a real son as a

firstborn son and he hoped that Israel

will take him as a true father but what

it is rayul do they were a prostitute

and left we've already studied that we

go back to the Torah dividing 30 to 5 or

Deuteronomy 30 to 5

David Amy is so much easier to pronounce

than Deuteronomy right yeah the venom is

a natural term dividing which means

words divert him you know the word devar

repetition of the word but it comes from

the word devar you see at the VARs word

the Vadim is a repetition of the word

repeated words but it's so much easier

to say then doubt or honor me it's a

horrible name Deuteronomy

kind of like Omni is demons Omni is

everything

omnis deuteronomy horrible hideous do

pterano

right do Toronto dude dude or not mine

yeah it sounds horrible deafening sounds

a lot nicer day about him farewell then

so in the variant to five the corruption

is not his the corruption is not of

Yahweh this text is rather very very

impressive corruption is that his of his

children as the blemish so then in the

father there is no corruption his

children are to blame

they are a crooked and twisted

generation there we have to work

generation we know that the word gen

narration gen comes originally from

Akkadian the word gen that's what we get

Jeanne an imprisoned demon genie

generation everything with our gen

precisely has to do with the devil

butter well in general but all the words

general but right Genesis Genesis

genocide but Genesis that word Genesis

genocide genocide already has a negative

context but what about those that have a

positive one but pay no mind to that I

just wanted to highlight that today but

pay no mind to it because there's

another word for generation a twisted

and perverse generation

let's read in the Torah cement which

says his children which is Israel

unworthy already of this name I love the

way they put it his children in other

words Israel unworthy already of this

name that's rather spectacular sinned

against him with their filthy idols a

depraved and perverse the generation

which up until today those who call

themselves Israelis there are generation

unworthy of that name who have sinned

against Yahweh and are a generation

depraved and perverse living in Israel

who just completed 70 years Jerusalem

2001 reads as follows

they have preferred it themselves who

has Israel they have perverted

themselves those whom he'd beget without

tear the word Tara first to a mental or

physical defect made perfect perfect and

it says that he begat them without any

defect so then they've rebel themselves

out of their own wickedness because he

didn't make them evil like that they

have perverted themselves those whom he

beget without tear a generation perverse

and

crooked there you have another

declaration from the Torah Facebook got

cut off but will continue that way

because we're about to wrap this up we

were gonna study John but there's no

time for us to study John because

actually in these texts of the Tanakh

we must centralize first the true

understanding before we continue to

advance but I wanted to leave this text

very clear and leave it clear forever

that when it talks about his son it is

Israel but I'll continue them with this

text which precisely at the end of them

our aim the Torah declares that Israel

is the son of Yahweh but it's perverse

in which they twisted last text about

how Yahweh has a son by the name of

Israel Jeremiah 31 2003 1:20 I'll read

from the New Living Translation it reads

as follows it's not Israel in your

Bibles your find Ephraim but that's a

way of referring to all of Israel it's

the same thing is that Israel or Ephraim

my beloved child actually what this text

is saying in Jeremiah 31 20 years is not

still Israel my beloved son my beloved

son doesn't that that sound like this is

my beloved Son in whom I am well-pleased

is not Israel still my son my beloved

child asked goe

often I have to punish him but even so I

love him that's why my heart longs for

him and surely will I have mercy on him

so then

what does it mean when a girl tells us

what is his name in the name of his son

if you know a giris telling us that all

of the true knowledge can only come from

one source which is the thought and that

source tells us the name of the only

Elohim that exists which is Yahweh in

his firstborn son which is Israel so

then he says that we could never

discover anywhere only in the trough you

cannot know it by investigating things

not even with a microscope a magnifying

glass or a telescope with and you're not

gonna go up to heaven cuz no one has

sent it to heaven or to send it to know

anything so then even if you elevate

yourself with a rocket or whatever you

won't know anything for the only thing

that contains the eternal truth is the

word of Yahweh says agar that's why it's

marvellous he says and if you want to

know who is the only Elohim who's the

creator you will find it in the trough

that is yahwah and if you want to know

who is the son of Yahweh you'll find in

the scripture that is Israel his

firstborn son that is the entire message

of agar which is marvelous that's why I

told you that it is rather fabulous when

we understand it in the given context it

is precisely what I wanted to leave this

in your minds impregnated the context of

proverbs 434 and why agar gives us that

so impressive a message and sometimes we

take away value from the Torah went out

of all the scriptures what has the most

value what is it

the trah because if we take out the rest

of those authors they are left feeble

and destroyed because they having a base

when they say for the law says what law

if the laws not wrong so then nothing

has a base if we don't place the true

base which is the trial and on top of

the trial we can build everything else

but I'd like to tell you an insanity

benas this is an

that you find rather insane this is a

second interpretation a second

interpretation of John 3:16 what does

John 3:16 say for God so loved the world

that He gave His only begotten Son that

whosoever believeth on him not perish

yet have eternal life and I explained to

you that Yahweh sent himself to the

world but now I explained it to you with

the second interpretation which also

valid absolutely valid I shall now read

my second interpretation for Elohim so

loved the world that he sent Israel to

the world that whosoever believeth on

Israel have eternal life do you think

that would be a false message it is

absolutely true you sure is looking to

the Samaritan woman said salvation comes

from

he didn't say salvation comes from

Yahweh because everybody's like

salvation comes from Yahweh he's just

like hey salvation comes from what from

the Jews says Yahweh and he told him I

mean her he told her salvation comes

from the Jews I rather find it

impressive once we understand who the

son of Yahweh is and in fact just wrap

this up I'll go even further if

salvation came through Israel for the

light is head by Israel his robe was

given the trough and now we understand

that Israel it is thank to Israel that

there is light in the world because if

they take over the Torah we don't know

anything about anything

we're some brute some ignorant fools so

then if Israel was given the Torah you

sure said salvation comes from the Jews

you shown the sermon of the mount said

ye are the light of the world we know

that he is the light that the light came

but he who is the light what did he tell

the Israelites ye are the light of the

world but I'll go even further the life

and death of the world depends of Israel

because the entire world will be judged

by the twelve tribes of Israel by the

144

thousand which are not Gentiles they are

not going they are not Pauline they are

true Israelites a hundred and forty-four

thousand judges opiate that number exact

or symbolic doesn't matter but all the

judges and Elohim that being the judge

is Elohim thousands judges to judge the

entire world so then the salvation life

and death who will have it Israel so

then Israel is precisely the one who

brought the light to the world the

salvation of the world in the judge of

the world it is all about Israel that is

why if we destroy draw and we want to

add things to throw out that it doesn't

say then we cannot be neither the light

of the world and we cannot judge the

world and the time didn't allow us to

read John 16 will read in the following

chapters but I wanted to leave this

absolutely clear something else I want

to be clear there's no need for you to

keep asking know drive me crazy with

questions but a in this text what about

this other text and this other text

you've got the golden rule already

you've got the golden rule already and

if you understood this message if you

understood this message that says

scheme' Israel listen Israel Yahweh our

Elohim Yahweh is one if you understand

this message then whatever texts you

read you have to pass them through this

rule and understand them forcefully

sometimes it's better to misunderstand

the text and not break this then to try

to to try to understand the other texts

as to and break this so then this

message is unique Yahweh had we're in

Chapter four there's gonna be a lot more

chapters because I know that and I also

desire to continue to read these texts

like we just read proverbs 30 so that

you comprehend them in other dimensions

but the other ones I've not explained

there's no need for you to ask but you

yourself have to

learn to use the rules that we have only

one Elohim and Elohim has a son that

sons name is Israel when yahwah came to

earth he also was the son of yahwah why

cuz he was an Israelite he was still

following the rule for he is an

Israelite Yahweh yes sure was an

Israelite so then the rule was never

broken the salvation the world came

through an Israelite and afterward

through Israel he subjected himself to

what he said my firstborn is Israel he

had to become an Israelite to save the

world as well in the same way so then

that is the central message of the

eternal truth the message has never

changed

we're just readjusting certain things

our worship from the beginning even

until the end of this ministry will

always be focused in one soul being by

the name of Yahweh about who when he

came to earth he made himself be called

Yeshua HaMashiach

he is our Elohim there is no Elohim

outside of him and he is our only reason

of existence and our only reason of why

we must obey the law and of why we are

saved that is it

hello him Yahweh Elohim is absolutely

everything in our life is the only one

that can forgive our sins he is the only

one that can redeem us and he is the

only one with whom we shall live as our

husband a subject we've already touched

in it's possible dimensions but that is

the promise of that Yahweh that he made

us and on top of that now he offers us

the possibility of becoming his bride

Alleluia to every one of you may the

Lord bless you and keep you know that we

are in moments of destruction when he

when it coincides with his plans which

are pre-established he's not waiting for

you not for me nor anybody it's just

that he traced the plan and he will

fulfill it in the propitious time and he

has not told us exactly the same day

because if we already know the day

it's already been determined six

thousand years ago but we now understand

and he has been revealing to us that

we're in the times in which he will show

his power and he will show that he has a

people he has a son by the name of

Israel and that son he made him his

bride and he will marry Israel with his

bride may the Lord bless you and keep

you

we shall conclude with a word of Prayer

beloved you sure that art in heaven

thank you Lord we give thee for you

speak to us clearly through Scripture

you are our only Elohim you are our

Creator our Father and also our husband

Lord we thank you because we have

understood that you have a people and

that people you designated it as your

son as your firstborn son and through

that people you have given the light the

Torah the laws and you will judge the

entire world through that people thank

you we give you for you have called us

to be a part of that people I ask you

that

really your not tarry

that this time go soon because the least

think that we want to do is to remain on

this earth we want to live with you

forever forgive our faults and sins and

really we are already tired of living in

this world of injustice and with desire

for your justice and your love towards

us that it may come true all these

promises that you have given unto us all

this we ask in the name of our only

eloheem Yeshua HaMashiach

may the Lord bless you and keep you yet

another Sabet without a studying John 16

but will study John 16 Nixa bet next

Shabbat don't you worry you can read it

and read it it is marvelous with

everything that I've said you've been

understanding it but I really want to

make it and leave it in video and that

we can conversate for it is a delight to

understand this tells just the beginning

it was a lot difficult for me to make

the decision

I've already declared that it was one it

was a little difficult for me it at the

beginning but just like everything else

has been just like everything else has

been like when we took out LG white when

we took out Paul oh we got Baptist in

the name of Yeshua

it is difficult at the beginning but

then later the light is so clear that

actually the light shines only one

Elohim that has the name of Yahweh and

also via Shu the same person and that

Israel is his people if the Lord allows

it we shall meet again next Shabbat many

blessings Alleluia

to every one of you
