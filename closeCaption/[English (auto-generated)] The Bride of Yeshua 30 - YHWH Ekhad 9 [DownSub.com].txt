shabbat shalom

Lynnette of the eternal truth and all

friends listening on this so precious

day of Shabbat from California from the

hot furnace which apparently is now on

fire

haha hell we shall spend together this

shebat and study one more chapter of the

bride of yeshua today is the 28th of the

4th month it's on its way out tomorrow

we shall see the moon we've already

talked about that of the five thousand

nine hundred eighty seven in yahwah's

calendar if yahwah wants to extend this

to its maximum then we'd have left

exactly twelve years in the couple

months twelve years in some months if he

wants to take this to the exact maximum

of the watch there is nothing to argue

but rather that's actually what it is

but as it turns out he gave us a date so

that we understand that we're very close

to his coming this corresponds in the

christian gregorian catholic roman

calendar to the 12th of august of the

year 2018 and we'll be studying the

bride of yeshua chapter 30 yahweh Ahad

part 9 and of course there will be a lot

more chapters of Yahweh God because

we're now comprehended who yahwah is

we're now comprehending what the

scripture say the parable which in all

of scripture we find it conservator in

the Sun today we'll have a specific

chapter which is called the wisdom I'll

talk a little bit more about this in a

bit let us pray unto our Elohim as your

blessed art thou us about we give you

thanks Lord for life and for the

opportunity of listening to your word

and for this Shabbat I ask you Lord that

your spirit be in every one of us

because Elohim gives us life so then a

very happy birthday to you Haiti and

today we'll be enjoying and celebrating

and thanking the Lord for giving you one

more year of life

it is impressive when we get to live

through events we've never lived through

before this week the holy fire as that

is known throughout the medium the holy

fire with a rather special name we got

to live it personally and feel it and

smell it and practically touch it the

fire is out of control Jesse get an idea

it is approximately 20 miles from this

house approximately I'd say 30

kilometers from here when it began it

would seem to be an actual nuclear bombs

explosion as you seen the images because

an entire column of smoke appeared and

then above that a whole mushroom it was

rather astonishing the pictures do it no

justice nor make the experience real not

even compared of feeling smelling and

seeing what what we're seeing it would

seem sub real not real it would seem

that we were stuck inside an apocalyptic

time the Sun became red the sun's

already red but it is red it is yellow

it is very white however you want to see

it but we cannot contemplate it but with

so much clouds so much smoke the Sun

looked red and we could see it without

it damaging our eyesight it looked like

a ball or a red circle rather

astonishing we could look at it the

whole time without it damaging our

eyesight it would seem to be something

strange rather strange the entire skies

were covered the temperature came down

because obviously when there's smoke

temperature falls noticeably so then we

actually got to experience in person

what a natural disaster is like whether

its natural or provoked or whatever

but in our real manner

obviously fires have always taken place

it's not anything new the fires are

something which are normal it is good

for nature when the woods catch on fire

the ashes enriched the soil and the soil

needs it to again create another forest

that is normal what is not normal is

that California is now living a

historical event with fires over 15

fires at this time which have cost for a

new record and it's never seen before it

is the greatest fire not the holy fire

precisely with that name holy fire we're

waiting for holy fire all the Christians

are waiting for the holy fire they all

think they have the holy fire which they

call the holy spirit the holy fire

Yeshua said that that we'd be baptized

with holy fire he wasn't referring to

that fire exactly he was referring to

something else but the name catches our

attention but the greatest fires taking

place in the North Carolinian it is a

rather brutal fights like that brutal

greater than Los Angeles that fire is

and the ashes in the smoke have already

arrived at New York and past New York

four thousand miles the ashes have

traveled and now New York has a rather

hostile environment in which the smoke

can be smelled there are which will call

it how do you say warnings and Spanish

that's the word there are warnings so

that the population take measure those

who have lung problems because the ashes

have reached over there but as Yeshua

said that the destruction that would

come to the world was as never before

seen and this fire was as never before

seen I'm not saying this is of the great

tribulation we could be in there or it

could be the anteroom to the Great

Tribulation interesting

all I can say is that living a fire of

this magnitude makes you see things

differently absolutely different all

we're seeing is that we're drawing near

to a time as the world has never lived

before and that we absolutely believe

and understand and it is prophesized

that it's called the Great Tribulation

and if we're in the Great Tribulation

all of this will be augmented if we're

not in the Great Tribulation and this is

nothing compared with that whatever it

might be it is so but the fire smoke is

not stopping because it's still out of

control so then those who don't have

smoke above them will be able to see the

moon because it'll be big so then go out

and look for the moon in the appropriate

time when the Sun is going down and

you'll be able to see it and please

publish your pictures when did I say

that this will take place tomorrow

Sunday and obviously it'll take place

and so then when the Sun Goes Down and

you see the moon it gives the initiation

to the month the month will be the fifth

one a very important month I won't talk

about it today but it's month of our

month of destruction destruction because

on the ninth of of starting with the

destruction because the people of Israel

did not want to enter into the promised

land and the progressive death of all

the Israelites began on the desert of

shin after that that month was marked

because of the destruction of the first

temple everything would have been left

there but precisely the ninth of our

tisha Bev was the destruction of the

second temple as well so then we see

that the people did not want to enter

into the promised land they returned to

the desert for years

they all died later the date was never

forgotten it was remembered because

Nebuchadnezzar came and destroyed the

temple on the ninth of of and then later

due to not

accepting Yeshua as yahwah as their only

eloheem on the 70th year in the roman

calendar precisely on the 70th on a

ninth of of the 70th year the

destruction of the second and last

temple of jerusalem came it's a very

interesting date many grave things have

happened there in regards to the people

of Israel so then we're gonna in turn to

this month which is the month of

destruction people who Israel after

having had a red moon has never seen

before and it'll never again be seen

during this century as if it were a

warning about an imminent destruction

that's coming we see war between Israel

and Palestine which actually the

situation is very tense throwing

missiles at each other

Palestine through it them more than

hundred and sixty missiles or bombs or

however you want to call it unto Israel

in Israel replied by destroying a whole

bunch of places that's not gonna stay

that way it's only gonna cause even more

violence so then as it turns out we're

entering into the month of destruction

on the 71st year after the 70th and

things get actually interesting rather

interesting all over the world were

seeing destructions as never before seen

this week I read a comment in Facebook

it reads as follows when I was born

homosexuality was prohibited that

happened to all of us extremely

prohibited then it was accepted but

hidden then openly accepted today dare

not speak ill of it during our timeline

I am living my 50th year I completed 49

and I am on my Jubilee my 50th when I

was born it was prohibited but it is now

prohibited to speak ill of it look at

how everything has changed it reads on

the commentary which made me laugh I

hope I die before it is obligatory

I actually loved it so then we went from

prohibited homosexuality to prohibit it

speaking against homosexuality what is

next

mandatory yes

you're either homosexual or jail time

they're like we don't care if you're

married you're either homosexual that's

the next thing that we need do you all

agree Danilo agrees he's us then Allah

says I don't want to die I want to see

with my own two eyes he says I've

already told you that before that have

you sure doesn't come that Avia sure

does not come soon we'd all be loved

obligated as those news might say we'd

be obligated okay very interesting very

interesting okay then today we shall

study a subject that I actually feel it

to be absolutely necessary we shall

change a concept that for many years we

held to be true we're gonna take out

that which we held to be true and we

shall replace it with something else

that actually is the truth okay then we

shall speak about something that we

shall change the concept thereof

substantially the way we had it we had

it wrong not completely wrong but if we

do not correct it we cannot comprehend

and now we shall unfold the subject

precisely

thanks to this is all thanks to what to

the Shema we now have the Shema

completely in Hebrew what is the Shema

say here o Israel Shema Israel Yahweh

Luhan ooh Yahweh our Elohim Yahweh is

one alone

Yahweh a hard

Yahweh HUD but this concept started to

change so many things that's why this

series will be long because there are

many things that we've got to study

review correct see and understand

precisely we have to study proverbs

chapter 8 I know that I've promised to

you Isaiah chapter 42 we'll get to

setting that we also have to study

Isaiah 44 45 46 and obviously John 17

and John chapter 8 in John chapter 1

will study them all and we haven't even

talked about revelation where it talks

about the father and the son the whole

time and let us not forget be epistles

of John first John second John third

John it's all about the father and the

son and he that denied the father and

the son is the Antichrist well study all

of that so then we've got to study all

of that that's why I told you that the

serious would be a long one because I

can't tell you all things together

quickly because I don't want you to

accept it I want you to understand it

there's a great difference in accepting

something and not understanding another

difference is to understand and accept

that which is understood so then you've

got to take the time and enjoy what we

will be studying proverbs 25:2 the glory

of Elohim is to conceal the word yet it

is the honor of the king to search out

the word what is it that we must do if

we think we're Kings to search out the

word very well then I've got a precious

gift today from danilo now this is not a

competition who gives me the best gift

because I'm not the next one will call

me in gold and all that I'm not saying

it would be a bad thing let's start with

silver at least anyway this is precious

made also in metal it's bulletproof

it'll stop at least an air rifle an air

rifle it'll stop it

it's interesting they

danilo I'll make it bigger so that it

covers more but it is made with a type

of very specialized tool which cuts

aren't in a way that human could never

do it by hand which is plasma but it is

actually like a laser that cuts it right

so then it cuts iron so precise so

perfectly well that we could never

humanly do it without that machine

that's why I don't know if you can see

this in the video it is very dark if you

could see it in video the letters are

cut out they're cut out I don't know if

you can see it in the video but in

person we can really appreciate it it's

a shim Izrael Shema maybe at this angle

we see it better there I see it there I

can see it there SH mi Israel and

there's a missing comma here but just

imagine it bring it from here over to

here share my Israel Yahweh Elohim ooh

Yahweh had many thanks to Danilo

actually spectacular precious thank you

because I know you do it wholeheartedly

and I really I really appreciate it

greatly

thank you Danilo for the flowers also

which are really precious I love them

they bring joy to the environment and

actually if we were missing the flowers

it would look rather different here so

then many thanks to Danilo for the

flowers

Jeremiah 16 19 through 21

the Spanish Nakata Colunga says Yahweh

my strength and my fortress my refuge in

the day of tribulation and to thee shall

come other peoples from the ends of the

earth and say only lies will have we

inherited from our fathers vanity and

how do you say vanity what is vanity yes

Kevin you

already forgot hey Belen what's happened

when I want more than that

no you don't remember bail bail

there are things of bail wherein there

is no profit if man is the one making

God since himself then they are not gods

they are not eloheem therefore behold I

will this once cause them to know I will

cost them to know mine hand in my might

and they should know that my name not

our names my name is Yahweh very well

then what is the problem with human

beings Yeshua said what it was Matthew

22 29 then you should answered and said

unto them unto him unto the scribes and

to the Pharisees ye do err

ignoring the scriptures

what is the problem and now you'll

understand that text even more ignoring

the word they ignore home do they ignore

Yahweh no they don't ignore y'all way

they ignore the scriptures the word

listen well because you'll understand

today even more you already understood

it before you'll understand it even

better today he do her Yeshua said this

who is Yahweh to whom the doctors of the

Torah that's what he's talking to ye who

had the Torah do earth what do you mean

we are you do why do we are because you

ignore the scriptures and what else the

power of Elohim today I'll understand

that even more that text you will when

you watch this video which you must

review remember today you'll hear it

live when you watch it again you'll say

oh now I understand that part now I

understand that part last Shabbat we

studied a rather magnificent study which

is John 16 I'd like to read it from a

different version John 16 12 through 14

as you already know the interpretation

of this text look at how it sounds now

and how it is easy to understand when

you have the correct interpretation the

spirit of the word John 16 12 through 14

Jerusalem 2001 you've got your shoes

speaking unto his disciples I still have

many things to say to you but now you

cannot bear them I could tell you a lot

but you could not bear it you could not

understand it and or accept it when he

cometh the Spirit of Truth the Spirit of

Truth he shall guide you into all the

truth

so then yahwah was not giving them the

entire truth let's start there Yeshua

HaMashiach who is Yahweh it was who is

the truth because he defined himself

with the truth he himself was saying I

can't give you the truth but he shall

come the Spirit of Truth he shall guide

you until the complete truth the one I'm

giving you is incomplete do you think I

am forcing the text for he will not

speak oh his own account but he shall

speak what he heareth and explaining to

you what is to come so then the Spirit

of Truth takes you to the complete truth

it's not that he didn't have the truth

before he had it but not completely you

see he sure gave the truth when we

talked about the father and the son

that's the truth when we talk about two

beings the father and the son you should

define that to be the truth but not that

complete truth do you understand that so

then why did we understand that as

clearly the truth because it is the

truth it was not incongruent to believe

in the father and the son that is the

truth but incomplete the truth because

you sure didn't lie when you should

smoke up the father's son he was not

lying he was comparing presenting

apparel which is not a lie because he

clearly told me that to parrot

he told it to them it's just that we

don't pay attention but to believe in

that parable is not to believe in lie do

you understand what I'm speaking here so

then you sure said I am giving you the

truth in parables but it is not the

complete truth when the Spirit of Truth

come he shall tell you the complete

truth he shall guide you into the

complete truth not just that but what he

shall explain what is to come he shall

give me glory third thing the complete

truth what is to come and also will give

me glory says Yeshua for he shall

receive of mine and shall explain it

unto you two things he comes to explain

those as well because he comes to

explain he's not referring to scriptures

he's not referring to the book of

Revelation because it says he shall

explain unto you the entire truth he

shall explain to you what is to come and

he shall explain and he shall explain

the glory that Yeshua has it is

astonishing we studied it in the last

chapter yahwah it had eight I just

wanted to read to you this version which

I found rather fantastic as you read it

and you understand it he that

understandeth let him understand today

subject we shall start because it's

first part wisdom proverbs 8 who is who

is we have one so interpretation from

2008 up until now 10 years ago we've

been holding up one interpretation I

shall read I shall not explain but I

will read this I shall explain next

Shabbat do not get your hopes up because

we've got a lot more things to

understand but I'll read it so that we

understand what we'll read next to bad

proverbs chapter 8 22 through 31 and I

shall read it in the book of the people

of God the book of the people of God

reads as follows Yahweh created me

as the first fruits of his ways before

his works since forever

I was formed since eternity since the

beginning before the origins of the

earth I was born when the abyss still

did not exist when there were no Springs

abounding with water before the

mountains had been shaped before the

hills I was brought forth before he had

made the earth with its fields on the

first of the dust of the world when he

established the heavens I was there when

he drew a circle on the face of the deep

when he made firm the skies above when

he established the fountains of the deep

when he assigned to the sea its limit so

that the waters might not transgress his

command when he marked out the

foundations of the earth then I was

beside him like a master workman and I

was daily his delight rejoicing before

his ways rejoicing in his inhabited

world and delighting in the children of

men it's been over ten years already in

which this part of chapter eight has

been our or part of the foundation of

the eternal truth with this we denied

the doctrine of the Trinity with this we

denied the

eternity backwards of Yeshua HaMashiach

this was one of the chapters the very

main ones by which we understood what we

understood about who you show was we

always accept that that wisdom was

Yeshua but not just we but all of

Christianity all of it it's not that we

are the sudden went from being

Trinitarian Christians said wait here's

not talking about wisdom it's talking

about Yeshua that is accepted by all the

Christians especially L&G white who was

she was a writer who claimed to be a

prophet which we accepted to be a

prophetess she clearly would say in many

texts that it's not necessary for me

read him to you

she said the chapter 8 of Proverbs was

Yeshua HaMashiach

oh Christ the way you understood before

said then already that base is accepted

by all the Adventists it is clearly

accepted by the Jehovah's Witnesses it's

accepted by all absolutely by everyone

now is it really that this wisdom is the

son of Elohim today I declared that it's

not it is mal expressed wisdom is not

Yeshua HaMashiach in the sense of

defining it that way I will define it in

a different way and you will understand

it if you go slow paying attention

leaving your pre concepts in your mind

of all your life because this is what we

inherited from our fathers it's not that

we invented it chapter 8 of Proverbs we

inherited it from our fathers we applied

it a little bit differently from what

our fathers told us but our Christian

fathers

taught us that wisdom was Yeshua it was

directly Yeshua there are many things

that I will explain from this chapter

but not today we have to go back in

order to understand Chapter eight we

have to go back to chapter one in order

to understand what the wisest meant of

all times whose name was slo-mo or

Solomon we have to understand the

concept of what he wants to teach us we

cannot take one text much less a whole

chapters and say this is this now the

other thing that I taught is something

else

no because the one who wrote this from

the very beginning defined to us who

wisdom was so then we cannot take

whatever is to our taste as Christianity

does to say this means this now what he

said before means something else when

he's been talking about the same thing

do you follow okay once we finish

studying this you will have a complete

accepting of what I'm saying because you

will understand it not because I'm

telling it to you now but rather because

you will understand it all of this we

got to understand it thanks to this the

Shema if it weren't for the Shema then

we'd still uphold that wisdom is Yeshua

period that the personification of

wisdom is Yeshua let us begin with the

first liar founder of Christianity why

does Christianity believe that proverbs

8 refers to yoshua for what reason then

let's start with the founder of

Christianity whose name was Paul of

Tarsus what does Paul say but Paul of

Tarsus say when we would present not

just does but all of Christians proverbs

8 we go directly to 1st Corinthians 1:20

for 1:30 that if you remember what we

and preaching from 10 years ago the

relation between proverbs 8 and first

Corinthians 24 and 30 is absolutely

undeniable because he did fines for as

wet wisdom is first Corinthians 124

reads as follows but to those who are

called both Jews and Greeks it that

matters as everybody goes in both

Gentiles going as Israelites Christ and

I'm reading the way it is written as

we've always read it Christ the power of

lying in the wisdom of Elohim or wisdom

of God Christ power of God and wisdom of

God so then who defined wisdom to be

Christ

Paul did with this relation in scripture

when we have Paul as a true prophet then

Paul defines for us who wisdom is and we

cannot escape from that because Paul

defines who wisdom is so then since Paul

explains who the wisdom is then how can

we escape from there we cannot unless

with time yahwah makes us understand

that paul never was a true prophet of

his that he hasn't for a different task

as i've already explained in the

previous chapter but for the true

israelites paul is nobody and text 30

says yet through him are ye in Christ

Jesus whom God has made unto us wisdom

righteousness sanctification and

redemption

absolutely Christian the base of what

Christianity is when I want you to see

this because I know it's difficult what

I have to explain and I want to go slow

that's why I'm even speaking slow I

tried to bring down my mental

revolutions to speak slow I concentrated

to speak slowly at the time in which

Paul

that Christ is wisdom he closed what I

will speak about today he closed it

completely he closed it in such a way

that Christians cannot see what wisdom

is they cannot understand it because

Paul their founder took it away when you

comprehend what I'm about to teach today

what wisdom is he'll understand why the

Christians believe that way and why the

Israelites believe otherwise and why we

being the realest rights think otherwise

even if we sustain that the wisdom is

Yeshua we are left and closed in Paul as

simple as that

because when we speak about wisdom you

sure comes to mind he is the wisdom he

is Yahshua so then if we forgot

obtainable wisdom without go to Yeshua

because if he's the wisdom you're sure

for the Christians everything is what

you sure the rest is nothing Paul said

that for me nothing is worth anything

nothing exists but Christ crucified

that's what Paul said he says nothing

nothing is worth anything but what

Christ crucified according Paul wisdom

crucified if Christ is wisdom then

Paul's saying the only thing that has

anything that's worth for me and I don't

care about anything else is rather

wisdom crucified now what I have to tell

you today in which you'll understand we

were about to study what is what the

wisest men to fall just said up until

now what I'm explaining is well

understood right okay then wisdom the

word in Hebrew is hokhmah repeat it so

that you memorize it in your mind

not necessarily memorize it but so you

understand it hokhmah very well then

the wisest mint of all today I presented

a nation that gave you a sneak preview

here present but I want to say this

publicly because I've spoken a lot about

Solomon and David all the rest

I've spoken many things I know but the

reality is this Solomon was the wisest

being that has ever existed because

Yahweh gave him that wisdom we agree

with that right there is not one of us I

could even get to the ankles of Solomon

and wisdom no one absolutely no one no

one no one he is the only wisest one

that has ever existed as a man obviously

do not compare with Yeshua

talking about a man man on a percent man

let that be clear farewell then as a man

he was the wisest man of all being wise

Solomon he wrote things that were

absolutely marvelous that no other man

could ever write in the way he wrote

them in the way he placed them the words

he used demonstrate to us why he is the

wisest them of them all now not just

because he's wise or the wisest man of

all did he not make mistakes he made

mistakes he did what yahwah told not to

do he took many women that yahwah told

not to

he took women from outside of israel

yahwah told not to one sin always takes

you unto another a good deed always

takes you into another always what I've

just said is real when one does a good

deed it encourages to do another good

deed when one does one sin it

automatically you don't just do one sin

but it makes you do another thought o

matic it's a chain of events Solomon

made a mistake his sinned and that sin

took him unto another sin another sin

another sin and he ended up building

temples for his wives in honored unto

other gods and not unto Yahweh even

before Jerusalem in the sacred man

of the olives there he ended up building

temples according to what yahwah said is

that he would be cut off if he disobeyed

precisely in what he disobeyed Yahweh

fulfilled it because after Sullivan he

divided Israel and turned it into two

nations Israel and Judah up until today

and then Israel was dispersed all over

the world never again gathered it and

Judah was left there and was gathered

later Judah okay then

those prophecies we have studied them

we'll continue to study the complete

gathering of Israel but it's not today's

subject the thing is that Yahweh

fulfilled what he said now many times

I've said the solemn will be lost

because Solomon being the wisest man the

most intelligent of all committed sins

which we not being wise and intelligent

do not commit same thing as David I

would add him there let's add him there

David was not as wise as Solomon

obviously he was wise he was intelligent

but he committed sins that we condemned

the horrible sin they committed okay

then I've also said that from my point

of view I think that Solomon has a lot

of chances of being lost and David I

don't know about David all I've said I

believe is that I want him to be my king

I sustain it

I still uphold it but I want to leave in

your mind and correct in one way or

another that we'll study today is that

when we comprehend and we comprehend

what I said last Shabbat and this has

been given to me by Yahweh it's not that

I become soft in some way don't know

it's not me it's just that Yahweh it

makes me comprehend these things that

when one does a deed and that deed

transcends and helps millions of people

those deeds have weight to forgive

certain sins because if there are wicked

men that do wickedness but don't do

anything good

then all there is on their scale is

wickedness when there are men that do

good things and bad things we've got to

weigh by their works you should have

said it he said it clearly not by their

faith but by their works this is clear

because the Christians believe that it's

by their faith and it's by their works

Solomon the work of Solomon gets to our

days thanks to Solomon we're gonna

understand certain things

thanks to Solomon we have understood

many of their things no matter what he

has done we are eternally grateful to

Solomon due to the legacy he gave us not

just us but all those who read proverbs

Ecclesiastes and Song of Solomon we

agree with that so then that wisdom that

he poured over and gave to us has such a

weight that's brutal

even in regards to the sins that he

committed he will be judged but if he

were judged by me for were to be given

privilege to do so by hour of judging

Solomon aside from judging him seen up

close what he did in all the rest I tell

you the truth he would have almost his

salvation secured due to what he gave to

every one of us if a person discovers

something and saves a million lives he

saves them 1 million lives which if it

weren't for that man

that million would have died a certain

death let's suppose virus and that the

virus kills every person that that it

infects and that person discovers

something and with that that they

discovered and the wisdom that he gives

us he saves a million people after

having save a million people and there's

no more virus the guy goes crazy and he

kills 10 people so then

we say what an accursed man he killed 10

what a horrible person he deserves

eternal death okay we have to place

things on the scale he saved a million

he killed ten due to the ten he killed

is he going to hell and eternal death

and all of the other people that he

saved oh thank you we're gonna be

thankful our entire lives to that guy

who no longer exists

okay so then we've got to be very

careful we've got to learn what mercy

and truth are today we'll find that out

at least over the top I know that many

things that I am speaking about I'm

gonna see if I have enough time to

present the subject we have to learn

that if we're inflexible now now in this

life we would know and we're inflexible

and with the people that were given

because Solomon the only thing that he

gave us the sense of Solomon don't get

to me the wisdom of Solomon gets to me

every day and I have it there available

for me and if Solomon had not existed I

would not have that wisdom do you agree

with that so then we've got to learn to

not being so unflexible just like we

were before like saying this guy

believes in the Trinity he's going to

hell this guy's Catholic

he's got Hell guaranteed oh this guy

here you don't believe him what I

believe all he's dead he's our dead dead

man walking

sorry dead last Shabbat many were

astonished I know man he got astonished

with what I said that there are atheists

that will be saved and most of them in

my point of view most of the people I

cannot give a number but they'll be

saved because it still works what count

so then Solomon whose wisdom gets to me

up until today in you too and today

we'll see his wisdom and how his wisdom

impacts our lives yours and mine

we cannot say that guy will be lost he's

in the curse at no no no his since we're

gonna weigh them along with the good

things he did and Yahweh has his partner

cuz he always says he

dishonored me but maybe at the end of

times at the end of times when he wrote

Ecclesiastes maybe he wrote it at the

end of his times it's not clear when he

says everything is vanity

I've tried what it is to worship Allah

him and I've tried what it is not to

worship Elohim and I found anything to

be whatever it might be I found it to be

a piece of garbage vanity so then he

says my wisdom as a king the way he says

that I'm just telling to you my wisdom

as a king and since my wisdom is

appeared to every one of yours no one

can tell me anything that's what Solomon

says my wisdom is like none other

even that not with my wisdom all I did

was dig a hole for myself and I got to a

point where nothing else could contents

me I've noticed that the true wisdom is

not mine but rather another wisdom it is

said it is said I am explaining this

spirit was Solomon sane so then he says

I have noticed that in this life it is

all vanity there is one thing that is

not vanity and that is what we're about

to study today so then everything that

I've said about Solomon tell the truth

if it were up to me yahwah has to

demonstrate it and yahwah has decided

but for up to me Solomon I would wish to

see him alive and saved that is my

opinion my opinion has changed from what

I told you before because I value what

he has left me that gift he left me I

valued that gift did you understand my

words oh you didn't okay then it's not

that I'm becoming soft it's just that

the Lord has given me more wisdom more

wisdom those who deserve eternal death

are the wicked they deserve eternal

death but the wickedness of Solomon

didn't get to me what I got from Solomon

you know what I got from him his wisdom

as will got to me I read it I applied I

get marveled and I say thank you Solomon

for what you left written for me Thank

You Solomon for what you left written

for me same thing as David I wouldn't

want David as a king over me I wouldn't

want him but I would have him as a

companion David that is does anybody

have a problem with what I just said

proverbs chapter 1 because this we must

understand it this way before starting

to read proverbs chapter 1 I will begin

in text 20 the previous things has

nothing to do with wisdom so there's no

need to read it it's just an

introduction of the wicked I'd like to

explain something Solomon the wise

defined wisdom as a woman directly

wisdom for solemn is a woman and defined

it as a woman so then I start to give

form to wisdom what is wisdom a woman

just like that straight out what did I

say wasn't was a woman not because I say

so

the wise one said it who is that woman

that is what we're about to study and

demonstrate Ferelden i shall define it

now because if I don't define it now

then I had to read everything explain

everything and then I'll define it later

then you have to go back to what I said

before I'll define it now and as I'm

saying every single thing you'll be

understanding it wisdom is the word and

the word is a woman because of how it

was put by Solomon and the way it is

written by its feminine article it is a

woman the wisdom is the devar the word

and the word especially is the Torah

wisdom that's right in the picture of

the invitation we see the Torah wisdom

is a woman in that woman's name is Torah

Ketuvim

and naveen but mainly Torah this is the

woman Torah

not just the Torah the Torah is the main

part of the woman the rest speaks and

explains the Torah southern wisdom is

not Yeshua is the Torah Yeshua's Yahweh

he's a wise man's Wiseman but wisdom

personified is a woman and it is the

word in the word is the Tanakh but the

Tanakh begins with T because it's the

Torah Nevi'im and Ketuvim in that order

Tanna are the initials of Torah

naveen which are the prophets naveen and

Ketuvim which are the writings of the

psalms whatever that it's not directly

from a prophet but the writings of the

Psalms but the first and formost was

what Torah which includes the prophets

in the Psalms but in that order the

Torah when we comprehend that wisdom is

not Yeshua but rather the Torah we start

to see things that are absolutely

marvelous that we could not understand

before now let's go to proverbs it is

already defined not to prove it but it's

defined default all right it's defined I

defined it I haven't proven it I defined

it I'm about to prove it proverbs 120

through 33 I'll begin with text number

20 it reads as follows

wisdom cries aloud in the street what

does it cry out in the street do you see

is sure crying out in the streets have

you ever seen Yeshua or Yahweh crying

out in the street so then we start to

see what the wisemen is referring to in

all the streets of this earth could you

find a torah the scriptures

absolutely absolutely and I'm talking

about the world in which the scriptures

are not talking about China in those

places which are not mentioned in the

scripture but rather I'm talking about

the place that is the Dominion of the

scriptures in Israel who should be

crying out in Israel that heart but I'll

prove it even further wisdom cries aloud

in the streets raises her voice in the

markets cries out in the main places of

gathering so then in the places of

gathering the Church of synagogues

what is it what actually should be

studied Torah at the entrance of the

city gates she speaks her reasons

southern in the streets in the

marketplace the churches the city gates

everyone knows the Torah tell me about a

person in this world that knows not the

Torah do all the Christians know the

term of course they do

what is Torah Genesis a horrible name

that is she

Exodus Leviticus numbers Deuteronomy the

first five bucks if we remove the Torah

from Scripture what do we have left

nothing if you were to tell me you what

do you prefer

do you prefer to read the Gospels or

Torah there is no comparison of the

Gospels with the Torah if you were to

tell me what do you prefer revelation or

Torah

there's no comparison of Revelation with

Torah because the Gospels are

fulfillment of Terim but it's not Turab

in the Gospels you will not find how

Yahweh made the earth why he made it and

you will not find the prophecies found

in the Torah revelation could not even

exist without the Torah all the prophets

in Scripture could not exist without the

Torah so then what is the main and most

important thing Turab it's everything

it's everything base foundation and core

it's everything very well then

22 how long all simple ones the word

simple ones is petite in Hebrew which

means idiots ignorant fools or deceived

people here they translated it as simple

ones but the original word is idiots

ignorant fools or deceived ones I know

that when I say ignorant fools everyone

gets offended idiots also undeceived

once yeah give or take because no one

thinks they're deceived it's easier to

deceive than to come out of deceit but

the wise men here says how long a simple

ones bethey how long idiots

ignorant fools deceived ones will you

love being simple what's it being simple

being an idiot being an ignorant fool

and deceived how long will you love that

and the scoffers obviously those who

scoff at the Torah how long will they

delight in their scoffing and fools hate

science

three types of people simple ones which

are the idiots ignorant fools who are

deceived those are the simple ones we're

in that category in that category are

all of us because if we had been

deceived by our fathers what did we

receive from our fathers and those who

received lies are how deceive and to top

it off add that we're idiots and aside

from that at that were ignorant fools

because precisely issues that your

problem is what that ye ignored the

Scriptures he ignored the Scriptures and

the power southern in the word pity are

all of us simples we're all simple ones

then come the scoffers who could care

less and scoff and then we have the

fools the word fools means precisely in

the original the scoffers or those who

directly oppose one thing is to not

understand to be deceived to be an idiot

another thing is to be this another

thing is that that you scoff at that you

don't under

dent in the other is that wicked

directly the wicked in umpires the New

Living Translation translated as follows

simpletons that's all of us simpletons

just like that simpletons which means

Betty deceived ignorant fools what are

all of us I want your innards then don't

not get offended I'm not telling you the

Wiseman is telling you idiot ignorant

deceived how long will you insist in

your ignorance mockers another group how

long will you fools hate knowledge

idiots

another group how long will you hate

knowledge three types of people the

simpletons the mockers and the fools

twenty-three come and listen to my

counsel now I want you to understand

that since we started in text 20 that

the wisdom cries out in the streets what

it's crying out is what we're reading

the Wiseman is not speaking there but

rather the wisdom is the wisdom is

crying out the wisdom is raising our

voice what wisdom is saying how long o

simpletons how long will you deceived

idiot fools well you love precisely that

and not listen the one speaking is not

Solomon wisdom is speaking do you follow

the woman is speaking who is wisdom who

is the Torah she is speaking and

continue speaking turn back into my

reprehend not solomon's reprehensive but

there are prehension of the Torah turn

back and to my reprehensive behold I'll

pour out my spirit upon you who says

that the trial has a spirit it's not

speaking about Yeshua it's speaking

about the Spirit of the trough when I

read Torah when I read Torah and study

Torah in comprehend Torah I start to see

things differently because Torah

indicates the time of creation how long

it'll last who created why created it

how many

mother was our other Elohim aside from

that eloheem in my the image of God the

trusses no you're not the image of God

are Lehane you and your other feminine

part your wife that's the image of

Elohim because Paul said I am the image

of Elohim men are the image of Elohim

and Paul's a liar and that's why we now

have all the macho's there is no male

that has the image of Elohim the Torah

clearly which is the wisdom not Paul not

the prophets but the Torah's wisdom says

the image of Elohim is a men in a woman

made one so then when a male says I am

the image of Elohim it is the image of

ignorance not of Elohim it is the image

of a simpleton it is the image of deceit

because the Torah is wisdom it says that

yea we created man in his own image male

and female created he them so then the

image of Yahweh no matter how difficult

it is for males to understand that

because in their sinfulness their

ignorance our deceit they still have

clearly what Paul said I am the image of

Elohim and the wife it is by image

that's what Paul said so then M Paul

also said that wisdom is Yeshua not the

definitions of power they true we got to

remove them little by little

so then Yahweh has the image of a man

and a woman that is not me explaining it

it's explained by wisdom which is the

trough so then Torah tells you turn back

unto my reprehend

behold I will pour out my spirit so then

the Torah there is a spirit in the Torah

it's not dead words there is a spirit

upon you and make known unto you my

words if I read Torah and I am humble

enough to comprehend what the Torah says

not what I want to make the tras say but

what the Torah teaches me if I am humble

enough that Torah pours out a spirit and

that is clearly seen because when a

person fall

dah-dah-dah is not just creation but the

laws of elohim when a person follows the

laws of Elohim they do exactly what

Yahweh wants and that person becomes

something else when you see a wicked man

that steals from you when you see a

person that lies to you and swindles you

evidently he is not the spirit of the

Trotter you follow when you see a person

that you see them be impeccable in all

things I can assure you that they have

the spirit of the Torah because the

Torah tells you keep my Sabbath's that

rod tells you keep my feasts the trout

tells you do not do what you don't want

others to do unto you summed up along

with all the meats vote that are there

that there's no need for me to tell you

but when you see a person that actually

keeps Torah it's a different person to

those who do not keep it well that's the

spirit that is the spirit which the

Torah pours out over the person and

turns it into someone else they go from

working on Shabbat from lying and

stealing from wanting to always gain an

advantage over the other the Torah

removes all that makes you a person who

loves Yahweh has only one Yahweh because

that's what the trial says does not

commit injustice and it's a person as

loyal in all aspects that spirit is not

proper of the person because it goes

against the proper nature of the person

the proper nature of the person is to do

evil the Torah refrains you from doing

that and says don't do that but I want

to don't do it don't do it because I

don't allow it when I start to bring the

turret to my life my heart she changes

me that is the spirit it is not the Holy

Spirit as the Christians say the Holy

Spirit will change no no no the Spirit

of Truth will take you to what can

really change you which is the trough

wisdom whatever person that things they

are good and has no Torah they're not

good but are an idiot do you comprehend

I just said it's us behold thou shalt

pour out my spirit it is not the spirit

of Yahweh it is the spirit of the Torah

which shall were placed in the Torah

upon you so then the Christians who

precisely things to Paul they took out

the Torah look at what Paul did Paul

said the tries crucified now it's just

Christ for us notice that their guide is

nothing nothing their guide is nothing

because they are guided by Christ the

thing is that Christ does not speak to

them nor anything that has anything to

do with a lot speaks to them so then

they say we've kept the Holy Spirit they

could never have the Holy Spirit because

in the Torah is the Holy Spirit there it

is in the trough it is the Spirit of the

Torah that's the spirit of the Torah

yeah what does that come with his spirit

to inundate us precisely to inundate

people that reject wisdom so then the

Christians to what I'm not talking about

how they'll be judged I'm talking about

the Christian teaching the Christian

doctrine that Christian doctrine no

matter if it's 2 3 or 1 doesn't matter

Christian doctrine rejects precisely

what what the scripture defines as

wisdom so then what are they fools

because they reject the only thing in

scripture that makes them wise there's

nothing else so then the one I receive

another spirit the Spirit of Christ is

what they want when that Torah it is

defined that the spirit of wisdom is not

in Paul not in the Gospels not in

Revelation but in the Torah that's why

it says turn back to my reprehend the

reprehend of the Torah and why is it a

reprehensive it is a reprehend because

precisely what we want to do it says

don't do that I want to have sex freely

you cannot you cannot I want it you

cannot I need to work on Saturday you

cannot I want to work on the days of the

feast you cannot I want to

I don't know well it's not that I want

to but I covet so much it says do not

covet everything that is written in the

Torah the only reason that it is written

there is to give you wisdom make him a

better person that's the spirit that is

the spirit but it is a reprehensive our

up Ranchin against our own nature

because we read the term we say oh how

beautiful it is not to covet yeah it is

beautiful the thing is generally we

covet generally we want to have our

desires not represented the tower

reprehensive the trusses don't do that

if you weren't to not do that it would

not say don't do that don't do that and

do this that's what I got a bit yes

that's what you got to do because if you

don't you'll receive this reward if you

do do it you'll receive this other

reward so then it says turn back to my

reprehensive why do you think that

Christianity the religion that's the

biggest that says they follow Yeshua

they nailed the Torah why do you think

because it's nothing but reprehensive

for them have to follow the Shabbat no

that is nailed to the cross absolutely

nailed to the cross doctor they are no

no no what I cannot eat pork

no that the pork and all those laws

they're all allowed I'm not trying to

say that he nailed the pork to the cross

because I want to eat it says the

Christian and pork and all I worship

Yahweh in honor Yahweh all they do is to

despise the wisdom from Scripture that's

why it says turn to my reprehend ssin

behold if we go back to the

representative Torah behold I'll pour

out my spirit of wisdom upon you and

I'll make my words known unto you notice

the masterly order here to go back to

the reprehensive the Torah the Torah

will pour out her spirit and make my

words be known unto you notice that I

can read the Torah without knowing the

words to know my words does not mean to

read the Torah it means to understand

what the trying to say that is what it

means to know my words as I can speak in

a different language or in Spanish and

you cannot understand what I'm trying to

say we already know that I can write a

comment to nobody understand that

comment until after

make my words be known unto you you sure

spoke to us about a parable but if we do

not know the words we get lost in

parable do you follow

okay so then the Torah says if you go

back to my Torah and study my Torah I

will pour out upon you the spirit of

mine which is the Torah and I'll make it

be understood on you what the word say

in the New Living Translation this says

come and listen to my advice it's

speaking about advices from the Torah

the more I'll pour out my heart the

heart that tries a heart per se it is

the spirit I shall open my heart unto

you and make you wise do you want to be

wise wisdom is not found in the Gospels

not Matthew Mark Luke or John the wisdom

isn't there wisdom is not in revelation

wisdom is not in the prophets the

prophets explained the wisdom the wisdom

is in the Torah do you understand what

I'm saying this is so important to

understand who is who the wisdom is you

see how this changes it is different

than to say wisdom is Yeshua than to say

wisdom is Torah 24 for I called who

calls as Torah causes for which I called

and you would not hear this happens to

all the Christians they want to hear the

Torah they don't want to hear the Torah

the Torah was crucified they say I

reached out to you and no one has heeded

because you have ignored all my counsel

isn't that what the Christians do they

ignore everything that what the Torah

says that is no longer because that is

for the Jews we are Gentiles in Yeshua

crucified it to the cross and we're two

peoples and out of the two peoples we

get a new people without Torah and we've

got the Nutri which is the New Covenant

is what they say that is what they call

the New Testament the New Testament

means New Covenant Old Testament means

all covenant so then they say I'm not

even going to read the Old Covenant if I

have the New Covenant so then the

Christians directly some

directly the Old Covenant which is the

Tanakh and they take it out of their

Bibles they only have their New Covenant

and what is the New Covenant Matthew

Mark Luke and John the false epistles of

Paul and Revelation that is no good that

is no good if they would have given me

that without ever reading the transept

is the book of allah him I would never

have gotten to Westham maybe I would

have been saved but never wisdom because

wisdom is not their wisdom isn't that

Torah

so then was the star say you despised

all my counsel and would have none of my

reproof course the counsel and reproof

of Torah that people do not want

anything to do with that nothing

absolutely nothing all right

we're all so mock when terror strikes

you Wow

the Torah who is a person who is a woman

says what and all of you left at me all

the Christians mocked the Torah they say

that that's not for me I'm a Gentile

that's not for me

what there's wisdom herself say this is

not solemn do you follow this is Torah

speaking the heart of the Torah Yahoo

inspired Solomon because he had the

greatest capacity to set the words in a

magnificent manner that nobody else

could and Yahweh's speaking directly to

us making us understand that that Torah

you see how here if you see there a tree

here in Torah because tarz a tree what

is true it is the Tree of Life and the

Wiseman says so and we're about to read

it excuse me no it is the Tree of Life

not an olive tree the Tree of Life the

Tree of Life

it says I also the Torah speaking since

you despised all my counsel and would

have none of my reproof I also will

laugh at your calamity and the word

calamity it is clear in the original

Hebrew and also said by those who

comment in the Talmud in this text

specifically they say that calamity is

not

talking about a calamity like a fire

that comes stalking about the calamity

of the final judgment because it is

clear in the context what Torah is

saying but the Taurus talking about here

is that she will laugh at the end of

times that's what's coming up in the

Great Tribulation I shall also laugh at

your calamity and will mark when your

greatest fears strike what does man fear

that's why we have the commentators will

really know about this

what man fears is the final judgment

it's not that they fear that all the

sudden they're gonna have a fire in

their house man fears death what man

fears is facing Elohim that is what man

fears they do what they want but

actually as it turns out man fears

facing God it says that that Torah will

laugh when man's fears come to him

that's why it is clear that it's talking

about the Great Tribulation and of death

of every person 27 when that which you

fear strikes you as a destruction and

now it is entirely in the context of the

end of time and your calamity comes like

a whirlwind and it literally says

suddenly unexpectedly that's a whirlwind

for you when tribulation and anguish

come upon you now it's directly speaking

for those who understand about the Great

Tribulation of the final times I shall

read this in the version I liked the

book of the people of God the Spanish

the book of the people of God it reads

as follows when terror invade you as a

storm and ruin gets to you even as a

hurricane when anguish and tribulation

come to you what will happen what will

happen with all those people who

rejected the council and the

reprehensive the tar what'll happen 28

then they will call upon me

oh now though

then they will call upon me but I will

not answer the whole Christian world

applies this to Yahweh it's not Yahweh

it's the Torah then they will call upon

me but I will not answer they will seek

me diligently but will not find me in

other words when the Great Tribulation

come everything which the Torah has to

offer it'll be way too late to try to

apply it and understand it you'll no

longer receive the spread the trial

gives you do you understand what I'm

saying this is clear name is in aim as

it is absolutely clear what I'm saying

Amos 8:11 through 12 aim is 8:11 through

12 Jerusalem 2001 behold the days come

word of Yahweh that I will send a famine

in the land days will come in which

hours is that he will send famine in the

land not a famine of lehem bread those

of you who understand well ahem is not a

famine of lehem of bread of food nor a

thirst for water but of hearing the word

the devar of Yahweh to hear what does it

say the word and they shall wonder from

sea to sea wandering from the north even

to the east so from north to south in

search of the word now they're searching

the word and the true word is Torah that

is the word that is what wisdom is

they're gonna search the word because

the Christians have the word as being

what the Word of John Mark and

especially from Paul the word of Paul

but they will those words is not gonna

be enough because it doesn't fit in with

what they're gonna be seen so then

they'll look for the word not that of

Paul but the true word and they will

search it out to try to understand it it

says yet they will not find it period

will they find it that is exactly what

Torah said precisely the Torah said that

they will seek meat but will not find me

I will laugh at you the trousers 29 we

continue on

with proverbs 29 why will they not find

her notice here it comes with the trough

says because they hate it wisdom what is

the people's problem but where is wisdom

in the truck it's not Impala it's not in

the Gospels in the trough because they

hated knowledge and did not choose the

fear of Yahweh nor nor would have none

of my counsel and despised all my

reproof so then have you ever heard

Yahweh giving counsel and reproof where

is the reproof of Yahweh which he left

to the human beings where are they in

the drawer where the pencil in the

drawer the council are not and john much

less than Paul why do I repeat that

because it's fundamental that we

understand that if what we understand

today about Yahweh HUD where did we find

this in the drawer we had for a time

deviated from the Torah when Yahweh

explained the parable to us he based the

parable in the Torah default what I'm

saying

you always said you've got to understand

the parable I cannot tell you now but

this secret has always been where

where's the wisdom where in the Torah in

the Torah 30 would have none of my

counsel and despised all my reproof

therefore they shall eat the fruit of

their way and have their fill of their

own devices for the turning away of

those who are ignorant once again once

again we have the word that I told you

before which is called Bethy Bethy

this time I didn't say is the simple it

called them ignorant but it's actually

the turning away of the simple actually

the p'tee simple ignorant the saved for

the turning away of the ignorant shall

be their death Wow here it is very clear

what happens with those who do not pay

attention the draw

they're gonna die they're gonna die what

is all Christianity waiting for a

rapture

what is that rapture I've already told

you it is death it is death they think

that they're gonna be raptured unto

heaven and I've told you they'll be

raptured all right but to the grave

where they'll wait for judgment oh the

Christians without any exception will be

raptured because there's no Christian

but the 144,000 144,000 sealed from the

tribes of Israel so then where are they

from that people they're Israelite

if we are not Israelite we're not a part

of 144,000 is there anymore aside from

us more than those of us who have a

group called the eternal truth obviously

there has to be more obviously there has

to be more do I worry about them now of

course not because Elohim calls them did

they understand everything which we

understand I don't worry about that did

they understand more than what we

understand I don't think so but I don't

worry about it either what I worry about

is but what I understand what you

understand that's what I worry about and

we've got to understand very clearly the

144,000 are Israelite they're never

Christians and here it clearly says

precisely that they will go where even

unto death it clearly says so because

the turning away of those were ignorant

those who reject Torah will be killed in

the prosperity of the fools will destroy

them that prosperity that they think

they have that about the era of grace

that they think they have will lead them

unto destruction 33 but whoever listens

to me if someone hears do they have to

hear eloheem they have to hear the

wisdom and whose wisdom Torah but

whoever listens to me will dwell secure

and will be at ease without dread of

disaster there is no threat of disaster

for those who actually believes in the

Torah and you know that in the Tri even

the coming of Yahweh is defined who

yahwah is it defines when the Messiah

would come

they also defined wellwe've re studied

at the Great Tribulation the pyramid

which is defined in those days and I

believe that there's a lot more in those

six days of creation we know that man

would be created barely prophetically in

the sixth day after the beasts after the

Messiah came do you follow the Messiah

came and the beasts came and then men

comes and then the Chevette comes and

what are we waiting for the Shabbat now

why do we keep Shabbat well first of all

because we've got wisdom and we accept

wisdom why do the Christians not keep

Shabbat it is pure because they don't

understand what Shabbat is clearly and

that is why since they don't so much

Shabbat is hardly understand the rest

Shabbat means a thousand years of

judgment in heaven it is the bride the

bride of Yahweh is Israelite Jerusalem

2001 in text 33 says but whoever listens

to me will dwell secure cake back and

without fear of disaster do you think I

fear disaster no no if you fear disaster

is because you haven't understood the

prophecies we do not fear disaster the

Christians never meant all desperate

everything will catch on fire no no I

tell you I tell you about the news to

make you glad if the whole world were at

peace I would be said because I would

see the return of our husband Wow very

far away so then why do I tell you

everything is being burnt there's a fire

like never before destruction is like

never before it is a disaster the smoke

is in my house hallelujah it makes me

glad it makes me glad Christians are

praying for Yahweh to stop the

destruction

let us pray for this let's pray for

Guatemala to not send another hurricane

and destroy Guatemala completely now if

all the volcanoes stopped if everything

were to stop I'd say wow ok so then that

means that we're gonna die of old age

without seeing her husband

how sad we don't understand anything we

know that we have left only 12 years

maximum 12 years tops so then we become

glad that the signs show us that our

husband is coming so them do we have

fear no it's contrary to fear they're

gonna vaccinate us give us the chip a

chip like this they're gonna give us

that we're all gonna become homosexual

makes me glad not because I'm gay but it

makes us glad that they are signs that

yahwah comes what I said is understood

right okay clearly so farewell very well

to live through it is impressive when I

saw the whole destruction that I saw I

will became glad I wish it would get

even closer tell the truth I would want

to see also in other places people are

gonna say oh this guy's crazy

no not crazy I want to come and see our

husband I want to see actually what is

written to be fulfilled did you know

that years should define this

marvelously

but I want 33 to be left clear but

whoever listens to me I've just read it

we don't hear the word of Yahweh no one

hears the word of Yahweh if you tell me

that you hear the word of Yahweh

directly you're a liar you're a liar

here it says he that heareth me so then

where do we actually hear what yahwah

has to say to us in the torah in the

Torah yoshua said let us go to Luke 11

49 through 42 in a read in the book of

the people of God it is fantastic this

part is it's rather fantastic Luke a

book which is historical you already

know that the whole New Testament has no

comparison with what taurah is you

already know that I've already said it

I've already declared it Luke 11 49

through 52 the book of the people of God

reads as follows look at what you said

therefore also the wisdom of Elohim said

well you should said what

in order to quote the scriptures or to

sum up because he didn't really quote

something but he's some certain things

from the Torah you sure

what did he call it Tanakh he defined it

directly therefore also the wisdom of

Allah he said he was speaking we thought

that he was the wisdom but Yeshua

himself says the wisdom of Elohim said I

will send them prophets and apostles

some of whom they will kill and

persecute so that the blood of all the

prophets shed from the foundation of the

world may be charged against this

generation from the blood of Abel to the

blood of Zechariah who perished between

the altar and the sanctuary yes I tell

you it will be required of this

generation woe to you lawyers of the

Torah says Yeshua the law it did when

you reap law the original word is Torah

so then it says you should sesson to

them you see how it says that the wisdom

of Elohim said there's any refers to

this just won't to you doctors of the

Torah listen well to this because it's

magnificent woe to you doctors of the

Torah for you have taken away the key of

science the key of wisdom gnosis is the

word in Greek from Luke gnosis but the

word gnosis is the word wisdom in Hebrew

he didn't say it in Greek he said in

Hebrew but it be original that is where

we get the Gnostics the wise men those

of science of intelligence knowledge

okay you sure says the doctors of the

Torah those who are specialists in the

Torah it says that they shall take away

what did they take away these doctors of

the Torah obviously of the Torah right

it says they take away the key how does

y'all we call the Trop yeah we should

say think the key so then where is the

key of all wisdom in Scripture Yeshua

said so

not uh you're reading it in your

scriptures because they have taken away

the key of science you did not enter

yourselves of course because if you take

the key I'm about to explain what that

is you have taken away the key you do

not enter yourselves and you hinder

those who were entering what does that

mean you sure says you the doctors of

the law the doctors of the law and I

highlight that word the specialists of

the law who are the doctors the law

those who explain the law I told you the

DA has a spirit but the spirit you have

to understand it what it says to follow

the spirit because I can return

understand the thing if I'm turned

tearing I read three all over the place

and then I read Torah I don't want to

keep the shop at what did I learn from

the truck nothing absolutely nothing so

then you sure talks to the doctors we'll

try out the specialist those who explain

the experts those who interpret the law

unto the people says you who interprets

the law that's wrong to the people you

have the key the key in your hands not

as he says I'm not the key did you

notice that he says that I'm not the key

look at me note that he doesn't say that

he says you have the key what is the key

Torah because he told it him there are

now he says that key what do you do that

key which you have you have taken it

away and you don't enter because you

don't listen to what the Torah says so

then they took away the Torah they don't

really understand what the trough says

and what they explain this to people is

a lie so then those who want to enter

because they note that the Torah is the

truth but if they explain an incorrect

swear the trumpeter can understand what

do you understand the Christians come

and say yeah that turns nice it is for

the Israelites they took the key away

from you the people that actually want

to learn the truth and wisdom a pastor

comes as the try was nailed to the cross

what did he take away he took the key

away he kept it for himself because he

for a Christian the pastor's of 30s or

no he's the one who explains so then I

come with my Bible I have the key in my

hand I have the trial here in my hand of

pessaries that try you have

is nailed to the cross throw away we

follow Paul he's the chief architect

what did he do what I mean

notice what Yeshua says if it's not

exactly what's happening today it

doesn't only just happen today but it

happened in the day of your sure you

sure faces them who is you and says you

doctors of the Torah you are taking away

the salvation from the people of Israel

because the secret and the key of wisdom

you have it in your hands which is the

Torah but you keep it to yourselves you

don't explain it you don't understand it

you get lost due to not understanding it

and you don't allow those who want to

enter to enter Wow it is impressive that

text is absolutely impressive look here

I used to teach the Torah and I've

always taught you Torah but I taught you

Torah applied without understanding the

parable the father and the son but the

trial clearly says that there how many

one it tells us that the image of elohim

is who a man and a woman who become one

the Torah also explains all the days of

creation and it tells us that every one

of those days is equivalent to a

thousand years and it tells you what

will happen it also says how long it'll

last

the Torah also defined for us in what

year were living in it defined the

destruction for us of the ancient world

of the Great Flood and it also defined

to us the destruction that's coming now

by fire and we're pretty much seeing the

destruction that is coming the holy fire

the holy fire has begun and right on my

Jubilee that'd be very interesting very

good so then whatever preacher that

takes over the Torah is taken away the

key from the kingdom and you see that

the key of the kingdom is precisely

terms and who yahweh is and to

understand his meats votes which are his

Commandments this is fantastic

that's why I've got to understand all of

this before going into proverbs 8 but

time goes on and we've got to advance

the key of science is the Torah the

Torah is a woman symbolically obviously

symbolically that woman being

wisdom do you see how now we draw away

from what wisdom is as Christ that's not

Christ Christ himself using Christians

language Christ himself is telling you

that the key of the kingdom is the trial

not him he the key of the kingdom and

that key opens the door which is he

because a key opens a door he said I am

the door but to open the door you need a

key

no one can open that door if we don't

have the key and the key is tore off and

now let's go to proverbs chapter 2 today

I'd like to record that the Torah is

wisdom that wisdom is the Torah and

there's nothing else proverbs chapter 2

my son the talk continues to speak not

the Weizmann the Weisman is speaking for

the table my son have you received my

words not the words of Solomon what

words still have to receive of Psalm no

Solomon is speaking as if he were the

Torah that's why it's so magnificent

this book of Proverbs

if you receive the try tells you who is

the key of the kingdom my son have you

received my words and my Commandments

you treasure up within you how many

Commandments the Solomon have is that

that Solomon wrote the commandments

who's speaking here and I want you to

define that who's speaking here yeah I

was not speaking the one speaking is

wisdom and wisdom is a woman and wisdom

as Torah so then this is my son

if you receive my words and my

Commandments you treasure up within you

notice so clear it says receive my words

and keep my words within you because I

could read the drawing I keep the words

of the Torah

so how nice the people of Israel keep

the Shabbat the Feast very interesting

right and the Christians say just like

the people of Israel kept we're waiting

for the rapture in yom teruah

and you keep you on parent no no that's

what they do for the Israelites but we

are waiting for the rapture in your dead

wah they don't even keep you on Tarawa

they don't even know what it is

they've never experienced what it is to

be as a group or a lineage to keep it

but they look at the Israelites and say

we're waiting for it because he comes to

look for us

Christ is looking for us he's coming to

look for us and then the Israelites will

suffer seven years of tribulation that's

because they're hard-headed but our

prophet Paul said that at the end all of

Israel shall be saved they said but we

leave first who are the bride and the

wife of Yeshua and the wife is Gentile

the wife is a Gentile right the bride is

Gentile were Gentiles so then you show

us his bride Israel didn't want anything

do with him look for a bride from

outside wow what an example Lidia sure

gives it he look for somewhere outside

precisely what he never tells us don't

look for someone outside with a

Christian say he looked for a bride from

outside that's us but you're as lies now

nope but you're sure when he came he

says I came to the lost sheep of Israel

they said yes but we are now thanks to

Paul thanks to Paul he looked for us and

to top it off he told us to not become

Israelites no no no do not keep that no

no no that covenant is off but it is

with nut matter it is wisdom for Israel

our wisdom is called Christ and Christ

crucified you see that brutal difference

here there's a brutal difference here

that Ross says you have another wisdom

that is not mine where are you going to

the grave I don't want to save the lake

of fire to the grave you going to the

grave to rest until you're judged I mean

you're following clearly what I'm saying

it is not fantastic tell me it's not

fantastic this fantastic it really is

extraordinary so then it says my son if

you receive my words and my Commandments

you treasure up within you making your

ear attentive to wisdom which I am which

is atra and inclining your heart to

understanding yes if you call out for

insight and raise your voice to

understanding if you seek it like silver

inserts for it

as for hidden treasures what is the

treasure that we have to read it you

have to search her and to search her is

to understand it word by word what it's

saying because it is a treasure

it says Eve as silver you search for it

you think that the Christians search for

the Torah as if it were silver now they

look for silver first and if they have

time on a Sunday they were a little bit

of Torah but now that does not satisfy

what satisfies Paul because Paul says in

first Corinthians Romans the whole time

the Gospels they say the gospel is that

Christ came and if you believe in the

Lord Jesus Christ

you and your house are saved and saved

always saved but if I deviate and sent

you're always saved interesting all the

contrary with what the wisdom says the

wisdom says is as if you will search it

like silver and search it like treasure

then you will understand the fear of

yahwah do they understand the fear of

yahwah no what do you have to search for

to understand the fear of yahwah the

Torah and will find the knowledge of

Elohim so then did you know that we had

never found the real knowledge of Elohim

until we comprehended the drought and

the tries everything I'm telling you the

truth it's all there you find who Yahweh

is where yahwah came from per se why he

made man everything that i've explained

to you why he made adam why he made eve

why in that sequence why did he divide

Adam into to demonstrate something to

show something all that where is all

that found in Torah that's why it's so

important to understand Torah it's so

marvelous that's what precisely in

proverbs 30 says precisely I don't know

anything I'm the most ignorant of all

I've never seen anything I've done

anything if it weren't because due to

what those wrong he wouldn't know

anything who is the name of the creator

and who is the name of his son Israel I

didn't know who teaches me all that

Torah that is the knowledge of Allah I

could speak a lot about this but

an advance six for Yahweh gives wisdom

who gives wisdom yahwah does but he

gives it through whom that's wrong

there's no doubt about it and there's no

more wisdom than that which is found in

the Torah I could help you understand

and explain to you to understand certain

things Bohr is the true wisdom in

Toronto and Yahweh gives it to us

through a spirit which is in the Torah

because Yahweh gives wisdom and from his

mouth comes from the mouth of the tribe

because you don't hear Yahweh from her

mouth comes wisdom and intelligence he

stores up sound wisdom for the upright

he provides as those of us who are elect

sound wisdom but how does he do so

where's the sound whismur's it in Tehran

it is a shield unto those who walk

upright guarding the paths of justice

and watching over the way of his Kadosh

his Saints then barely then you will

understand righteousness and justice and

equity and every good path you see what

I said today what about Solomon and

justice all the good that Solomon did

all the sins he did made him deserve to

be lost to lose the kingdom he deserved

for a kingdom to be cut in two but we've

got to sieve the final justice Solomon

deserves eternal death or eternal life

what I believe is that he deserves her

life then you shall understand justice

judgment and equity and all good paths

for when wisdom come into your heart

and science were pleasant unto your soul

not just the tourists to come into her

heart but science as well the science

found in the Torah that humans shines

not NASA that the science of the wise

men but the science of the Torah who

taught us that the earth does not move

is flat in how yah we formed it worse

that found in Torah absolutely antara he

told us how the earth was formed period

that is the true science that is

the true wisdom that goes against the

whole world when wisdom the Torah enter

your heart and science were pleasant

into your soul discretion will watch

over you understanding will guard you

delivering you from the way of evil if

you don't have Torah we are destined to

go through evil ways from the man of

perverted speech who forsake the upright

ways to walk in the ways of darkness who

rejoice in doing evil and delight in the

perverseness of evil men whose paths are

crooked and who are devious in their

ways the only way of walking upright in

this life is through that the Torah

teaches you what is uprightness there's

nothing else that teaches you what is

correct or crooked but the Trop Paul's

not teaching the Matthew Mark Luke and

John and revelation do not teach you

what is right

they don't teach you what is right

because the alwah came to speak to

people that already had the trial he

didn't come to the Greek who don't have

the table do you see that's why he said

it is no good the Gospels aren't they're

no good if they're on the draw

yahwah came to the people who had torah

when you have an upright ways you can

understand all things but nothing

indicates to you what is correct or

crooked nobody does nothing absolutely

doesn't the Christians the rule they

have is that of the Spirit that they

have what spirit the spirit of Paul

spirit of Paul they have Paul says well

it's good and bad

Paul tells you so then the paths of the

Christians are completely crooked the

path of Torah is the path of science and

wisdom and straight absolutely straight

16 you will be delivered from the

forbidden woman Wow here is when the

wise men says the Torah who is the wise

woman she is wisdom

she is the personification of a woman

which is wisdom not a wise woman I want

you to understand one thing is a wise

woman and the thing is

in wisdom which is something else you

understood that right never say this is

the wise woman no this is not a wise

woman this is the woman wisdom which is

different it is the entire wisdom the

Tri Southern the Wiseman says there is

another woman well you've got the woman

wisdom and you've got the strange woman

and the strange woman is someone else's

she's someone else's other than Elohim

who complements you with her words so

then of course the Torah reproves you

the whole time and this strange woman

strange to Yahweh does what she

compliments you what do you think

there's so many Christians do the

Christians hear reproof in their

churches

no they're complemented with smooth

words all time their compliments upon

compliments upon compliment with smooth

words why did they come out so glad so

glad out of their churches because they

don't listen to thrive there were little

draw it's reproof if you're doing things

wrong why is it a reproof because she

wants you to lead a righteous life in

this life for you to have a straight

path straight as in regards to Torah not

as in regards to us in our eyes or

Paul's eyes righteous and Torre's eyes

that's the only righteous thing the rest

is nothing it could be righteous in our

own eyes but it's actually a crooked

path that leads to death so then it says

you'll be delivered from the other woman

the wisest men of all time says they're

two women wisdom and the strange woman

what do I call that strange woman it

might be wrong but the way I see it as

Babylon

you've got wisdom and then you've got

Babylon we could call her the woman of

false doctrines as you wish the false

woman the prostitute woman because here

it's defined that woman is what

prostitute

we've got wisdom and the prostitute

virgin because wisdom is virgin if the

other one is what prostitute that's why

I say it couldn't be anything else I was

in Babylon

you'll be delivered from the forbidden

woman who compliments with smooth words

look at how it's fitting a New Living

Translation wisdom the woman was

we'll save you from the immoral woman

from the seductive words of the

promiscuous woman so then precisely

we've got two paths a man and two women

someone would say two women in one path

what was that soap opera there are two

women to follow we there follow the

woman wisdom who guides you righteously

and is the key to eternal life or we

follow the seductive woman who's a

prostitute who does not reprove you but

compliments you she compliments you it's

nothing but pleasure absolute pleasure

wisdom is the Torah the strange woman

I call her Babylon 17 which for saketh

the companion of her youth and pay

attention to the words here it says that

this strange woman this prostitute

abandons the companion of her youth

listen well and forgetteth the Covenant

of her Elohim here we see many things

that this woman who was a prostitute

didn't abandon just anyone but abandoned

home Elohim it's not the woman of the

Dragon directly because the woman of the

Dragon never had a covenant with the

Lehane here it says she forgetteth the

covenant of her Elohim so in order for

the woman to forget the Covenant of

parallel hang she had to have had a

covenant with Allah hain before one

cannot forget something that you never

had do we follow this southern who is it

specifically when we understand this who

is sane or what it's given us the one

who forgot the covenant with their

eloheem were two nations Israel the

first and main one and Christianity the

rest when did they ever had a covenant

with Allah heem Islam did they ever have

a covenant with Allah he never they

wanted to have a coven with the law but

they never abandoned that Kevin is Allah

they continued with it we're talking

about a woman that had a covenant and

that covenant is it is a covenant who is

in

our youth at the beginning of her days

she respected and then it says what she

forgot the Covenant of her Elohim she

abandoned the guide of her youth

directly it is speaking about Israel who

abandoned the Covenant even if today

they want to go back to the Covenant

they no longer have a covenant because

one the one that came to come from that

covenant they rejected him so then they

broke that covenant and the other is

Christianity what did they do with that

covenant it is abandoned it is crucified

that covenant is they themselves say the

Covenant is crucified so then that woman

would clearly identify her that

prostitute is called Israel and

Christianity which I'll call Babylon

which is the one taking up space in the

Land of Israel now 18 for her house and

Klein it unto death Wow

what happens to those who do not have

the covenant with Elohim they are

inclined unto the grave there is no

doubt about it and her paths and to the

Dead there's no other way about it

because the Torah is the key to eternal

life the key of eternal life the trod

takes us to the door the doors Yahweh if

they who have the key you sure tell them

you have the key you the doctors but

they took it away and they took it away

from the rest and then we have the

Talmud and all the rest they took out

the key because the Talmud speaks

against the prostitute Maryam Mary who

had a kid whose name was Yeshua who is

the son of the prostitute Mary yes sure

are you sure

however they want to pronounce it so

what do they do they took out the key

Wow

it is incredible incredible if you go

back and read the text that I've given

you'll comprehend it you sure told it to

their face he says you take away the key

you don't enter and the people don't

enter because they took out the key so

then even if they have the Torah that

key doesn't work

because it doesn't open the door because

doors you sure are you comprehending

this whole message it says her house and

clan it on to death the New Living

Translation says entering her house in

the house of these people who are the

prostitute seductress and of course

Christianity is seduced the Messianic

grew even more seduced they were

Messianic things and they play the which

we call it the shofar and they speak

Hebrew and blah blah blah then of the

key

they speak all kinds of nonsense that's

not wisdom do you comprehend the

difference they are seduced they seduce

the people saying wow this guy sings in

Hebrew how beautiful here I feel I feel

nothing they feel you know what they

feel pulse power and the power of the

Talmud two things Pau and the Talmud

Paul for the Christians in Messianic and

tell mood for the rest those two things

those two things take away the key

believe it or not they take away the key

the Talmud takes away issue and Paul

takes away wisdom it goes on the text is

magnificent

it says entering her house whether it's

Christian or Jewish leads to death it is

the road to the grave 19 all men who

visit her this woman she because it's

talking about two women are you

understanding two women the virgin was

called Torah who is wisdom in the

prostitute which I call Babylon clearly

all who visit her are doomed Wow be

careful because once you know the truth

you get to her you don't return we were

born in her but left her we were born

stubborn we're born idiot simpletons and

deceived but we left that woman there is

not one of us that wasn't born out of

either of those two women either of

those two women but you should took us

out the wisdom took us out of there but

if we go back there what's the text say

cannot return all who visit her are

doomed

they will never reach the paths of life

20 that thou mayest walk in the way of

the get men it's talking to us those who

follow the woman the virgin woman wisdom

that thou mayst walk in the way of the

good men and keep the paths of the

righteous the New Living Translation

number 20 says you on the other hand

don't follow that woman follow the steps

of good men instead and stay on the

paths of the righteous 21 for the

righteous the just shall dwell in the

land and the perfect shall remain in it

new living translation the 21 says for

only the godly will live in the land and

those with integrity will remain in it

what lands talking about the eternal

land talking about eternal salvation 22

yet the wicked shall be cut off from the

earth and transgressors shall be rooted

out of her New Living Translation very

clear this text says but the wicked will

be removed from land and that treasures

will be ripped out from the root now

let's go to chapter 3 que sera sera

I'll read it otherwise next Abed I

cannot give chapter 8 which is

magnificent

chapter 3 my child who's speaking there

okay wisdom is speaking is not Solomon

speaking yes he wrote but who's speaking

wisdom which is Torah my child forget

not my Torah Wow forgetting up my Turab

directly in your Bibles you'll read my

law my teaching my instruction etc etc

etc it doesn't say that the original

says forget

my Tehran but let thine heart keep my

Commandments in other words if Solomon

were speaking he could not say my

Commandments because the commandments

don't belong to him so then actually the

one speaking here's Yahweh directly

because it says don't forget my turret

who owns the Torah at the end of it all

yahwah does forget not my turret my

child do not forget i'm gonna highlight

this lot forget not my table

but let thine heart keep preserve is the

original word does not keep keep is well

translated will translate it but the

word is to preserve wipe to preserve I

can keep this and keep it anyway to

preserve is precisely to treasure

carefully and to not let it be ruined in

your heart I can keep something forget

and get it ruined to preserve it is to

keep it in its best state alive and

where must we preserve it in our heart

so then we've got to transfer to raw not

just listen to me and say how nice was

today's subject I loved it but rather to

transfer Torah to understand when I say

something and define something which is

clearly in the draw one shouldn't only

say how nice you have to write it here

when we say that Elohim said let us make

man it is clear that is more more than

will Haim one cannot argue with that let

us make man in our image you must

memorize it here how many Elohim are

speaking more than one there's more than

one period there's more than one of the

tosses that the wisdom says it because

later it said just in case later it said

let us kick men out because men has

sinned and if he were to stretch out his

hand and eat from the tree he'll be like

one of us who knows good and evil so

then this type of race which is called

Elohim knows good and evil and when Adam

and Eve their eyes were opened in a noon

good and evil Elohim said to another

Elohim whether you like it or not

Elohim said to another Elohim if you

don't understand that you're always

gonna be spinning when Elohim tells

another Elohim

let's take these mint from here because

there will become as one of us

Elohim he's not speaking with an angel

so then it says my son forget not my

Torah but let thine heart keep preserve

my Commandments I found only two

scriptures or two versions of the

scriptures which named Torah for example

in the scriptures 98 whose translation

was made by the Institute for scripture

research the Institute for scripture

research it reads as follows my son do

not forget my Torah and let your heart

watch over my commands and the other one

which I was able to find that says Torah

is the is the I V which is the Israeli

authorized version which is my son

forget not my Torah but let thine heart

keep my Commandments it's the ancient

English from King James which is

difficult to pronounce but it says my

son forget not my Torah clearly so and

obviously this is a commandment that's

so fundamental for us the day we forget

Torre's they will lose our lives too not

just because I say it but because we

just read it if I forget Torah what

happens I lose my life exactly I go

directly to death because life the Torah

is life - for length of days and long

life and peace shall they add to B it

says that the tribe will give me what

length of days and years of life shall

they add to be now the expression years

of life clearly we had never understood

it clearly years of life does not mean

May

years but rather years of good life

because there can be years of bad life

we can have years of suffering with the

tars trying to tell us here is that

years of life are years of life and

peace good years one can live 80 years

and live your entire life awfully

depressed and angry and with pain but

the Torah promises you that if you make

the Torah the main rule of your life it

says that you live years and years of

life not years of death or pain do you

understand that expression in Hebrew

when you translate it it may seem as if

it's many years of life that isn't so it

is years of a good life that's what it's

saying

so then what precisely you're being told

here by the wise men of what the Torah

Lee is that we in our life our time

lapse no matter how many years we have

if we make the two-hour guide

it'll be good years of life doesn't say

you'll live a long time that's not the

promise you could die at any time but it

doesn't matter when you die you have

peace and tranquility in the years that

you have lived you have lived them of

life do you understand because the surah

gives you life the spirit of life have

you understood this so then I do not

study Torah and you should not study

taught to live a long time because maybe

the wicked men live a hundred and twenty

years and they hate the Torah and maybe

we who love the Torah have to live a

short time and you may be like well then

how is this word being fulfilled well

it's not promising length of days but

rather it's promising that whatever you

live it'll be a good life without mental

problems of remorse and without fear it

precisely explained to that whoever

keeps the trout does not fear anything

doesn't fear anything everything catches

fire your own fear the world ends you'd

be glad he does

not keep the Torah even if they live for

a long days their years of life aren't

good notice the difference that the

Wiseman tells us in Proverbs 10 27 write

down all these texts are fabulous look

at the astonishing contrast proverbs 10

27 the same Wiseman says the fear of

yahwah prolong death days but the years

of the wicked shall be shortened there's

the difference fear of Yahweh prolongs

the days but the years of the wicked are

shortened those years no matter if they

live a hundred and twenty years those

years are terrible because don't tell me

that the wicked die young it would seem

that the good and righteous die young

only the good die young

there are many phrases of that style and

notice also how the Wiseman says those

in Ecclesiastes 12 1 Ecclesiastes 12:1

remember now thy creator in the days of

the youth before the evil days come

these are the evil years lest the years

draw nigh precisely we either have good

years or bad years lest a years are nigh

when thou shalt say I have no pleasure

in them now if you study Torah you'll

never say I have no pleasure in them

because the Trop isn't it to say a

Wiseman one time he said life is a

mountain when we were young we go up

with lots of energy we go up and we go

up and we grow and we grow with strength

and we go up until we get halfway and

there we start to go down and even if we

don't want to go down we go down until

we can't go up anymore it would

disappear that is human philosophy what

a wise human said not the process that

incident so that is human wisdom to go

up and go down physically it is possible

that it's that way but spiritually the

Torah promises something else

spiritually the

this life this life is an ever ascending

path if you study Torah and you

comprehend wisdom the older you are the

more you'll understand and the more

you'll know and you'll never get to a

point where you come down wisdom doesn't

make you descend wisdom will make you

ascend until you always says you either

go to rest or he comes to look for you

one of the two are you following the

difference human wisdom you go up and

down because they look at it physically

only but the trough says it doesn't

matter how limited you are physically

your soul will be happy and glad if you

study wisdom on a permanent basis is not

to know it is to search her and

understand her and read her and treasure

her and preserve her in your heart my

son forget not my Torah my son forget

not my Torah remember that in your mind

3 never let mercy in truth forsake thee

that's precisely what I told you about

Solomon sometimes when we have lots of

truth we forget about mercy things are

like this and this is truth and if you

don't have any truth then you can rot in

hell

just like that Turkey I have the truth

that God believes in 3 what a poor

wretch let him die for example and my

mom who believed there are three let her

rot in hell that right there when we

treasure the truth and we forget mercy

the more truth we have the more mercy we

should have because it is a scale look

if we with the absolute truth could we

go to a place no we'd all be destroyed

because we don't have the whole truth

first of all and if yahwah comes and he

demonstrates that we have some lies or

that we are alive or whatever he wants

to demonstrate the lies do you have any

chance no Yahweh is a balance between

truth and mercy

where does mercy enter in the part where

we lack truth so then the more truth the

more mercy that there has to exist the

understand very diff

what Paul said he said were there's

abundance in Gracie buns

that's what Paul said the more send more

grace no no that's not what I'm saying

I'm saying that if we are owners of the

truth we have to develop mercy because

otherwise we don't have the truth

because truth is part of mercy that is

why I have radically changed by saying

we are privileged to understand certain

things but I will not take the liter no

life from anyway because they don't

believe what I believe do you understand

to comprehend because they don't believe

what I believe so then anyone want to be

a judge for Yahweh Yahweh says first

you've got to learn one thing I can give

you a lot of truth but the more truth I

give you you've got a develop mercy

you've got to develop it because if you

don't you're gonna judge the whole world

incident to the lake of fire why am I

gonna take you to judge if they don't

have your truth you're gonna send a lake

of fire this guy believed in three there

you go this guy believed that the father

was yahwah in the son to the fire this

couldn't believe got there this guy

believed in a lot there and so then who

are you gonna judge if you've judged

them all already do you understand what

is truth and mercy so then truth and

mercy in the Torah which is wisdom

itself says precisely never let mercy

and truth draw away from thee notice

that Mercy's first and truth because if

Yahweh were to judges first with truth

were we're gonna end up if we had

nothing but lies what did we hurt from

her father's so then if the truth were

to go first with already all of us being

like fire

so then yahwah says first is mercy in

then truth

let not mercy and truth for safety find

them about thy neck both things so then

when we become legalist ear wretch fool

because you don't understand you have a

wrong calendar you follow

Enochs calendar and i follow the moon

calendar actually follow whatever

calendar but just keep the feast just

like i keep the feast that for me is

more important to keep the feast

with what

calendar you understand to be true than

to say I don't care and keep any feast

do you follow if you were to tell me lug

your birthday will never be third of

August it will be precisely in my

calendar I'm gonna celebrate the fruit

then go ahead and celebrate it for me

I'll accept it

if that for you that's my birthday

whatever day I don't know as long as

it's not in the ninth of odd that's fine

not the ninth of all but look for any

other day in my calendar or the fourth I

can't remember the date that'll be your

killer okay come and celebrate okay what

we celebrate we think but I could care

less what I have made truth and mercy

not because it was my idea but because

it's written it says that we have to

bind truth and mercy to our neck to our

neck so then what does that mean it

means that everything that we do we are

subject to it as if we were a slave

because slaves and animals to subject

them what would you add to them

something to their neck in their neck to

subject them and it says I wanted you to

be subject to what first to mercy and

then truth don't leave truth aside they

have the same value but mercy in truth

never believed that you're subject to

truth because you're gonna look at

everybody without mercy do you come from

what I'm trying to say it's very

fundamental what I'm saying I've already

taught at last Shabbat a little bit and

the Shabbat says precisely Shema Israel

the Christians who are not Israelite

because they don't even want to be I

cannot judge them by shimma Israel

because this is my Israel they're

like ah that's not me that's fine I

understand where they're headed

and understand they'll be judged but I

do not condemn them do you understand I

don't condemn them because by mercy I

was called just like you by mercy and

their deceit just like you were deceived

like the whole world but Yahweh for some

reason by mercy not by truth because we

didn't have the truth evidently we

weren't chosen by the truth that is

clear not because the truth that they

say oh you have lots of throw them a

teacher more truth no no no by mercy

call this to understand the truth so

then that is the relay

of judgment mercy and truth exactly tell

me that people was defined by Yahweh as

a prostitute not one to two prostitutes

says two prostitutes since they were

born they played the from birth

what did he bring them out of Egypt then

for mercy and he gave them the truth in

Sinai he gave them the truth in the

Covenant but notice he called him out by

mercy and then he told them I will give

you that land

not because they are worse than you will

I kick him out not because you're better

than them will I kick him out I'll give

him to you because I want you to have

them that is what call mercy it's not

called truth he doesn't say I'm gonna

give you that because you deserve it

because you have the truth no no no I

give you things out of mercy learn truth

so then he calls us by mercy to learn

truth and is the truth the Torah is

wisdom it is the truth which today we

are studying let not mercy in truth for

safety bind them about thy neck write

them up on the table of thine heart you

don't have to bind them here only as

someone that is enslaved Yahweh says and

slave yourself to two things what two

things mercy and truth but not just

become a slave it says write them in

your heart which what means is to

understand them practice them and let

them be a part of your nature one thing

is to be subject to and not want to be

subject and another thing is to write

them and to say I love mercy and truth

two different things so then first he

says subject yourself I don't understand

them subject yourself and then what and

then make them be a part of your nature

and I will finish up with this I will

study the whole chapter but I'll finish

with this definition these two things

are the two main rules of judgment mercy

first and truth if we were to judge

everyone with the truth or evil humor to

judges all with the truth none of us

would be saved every judgment is judged

with mercy and then with the truth what

truth the relative truth they had not

the absolute truth the relative truth

Yahweh himself said I'm giving you the

truth but not all the truth I'll give

you the truth later with the Spirit of

Truth but for now give you this truth

they could not handle any more truth so

then truth is relative to the truth

Yahweh who's the truth gave them

half-truths and then he said I'll

explain it to you when the spirit of

truth comes that's what he's called the

spirit of truth then you'll understand

lots of things and the other definition

is every text that we're reading in

proverbs 3 we have to go back to the

beginning

my son forget not my Torah and only then

will you understand mercy and truth

every text that you read from proverbs 3

which will continue read in the

following chapter in Yahweh hot 10 read

it this way the way the chapter begins

my son forget not my Torah and then read

where the Texas only then will you

understand mercy and truth alleluia to

everyone of you may the Lord bless you

keep you make you wise I make you

comprehend that the Torah wisdom is the

key of the kingdom of heaven

the key that opens the door the door is

Yeshua who is salvation of the kingdom

of heaven

both the doctors of the law like Paul

took away that key no one can get to

understand these things if they don't

have the key if the key is cast out if

it is crucified if it is transgressed no

one can comprehend what it is that

wisdom is that's why Paul took out the

key which the trials wisdom and he put

it in Yeshua so then for the Christians

Yeshua is wisdom and that's all they

need for that same reason does wisdom

itself say that their path is a path

unto death but ours who comprehend Torah

which the Torah shows us the path which

the Toraja shows us who are eloheem is

we can only be more than thankful to

mercy of Yahweh with us who shows us the

truth let us wrap up with a word of

Prayer blessed be thou yahwah save out

Lord only you can demonstrate be so deep

a truth you only defined that the Torah

is the wisdom of Elohim and that it is

the key of the kingdom by which those

who interpret her those who handle her

can take over her they don't enter

themselves not let anybody else enter

blessed be thou Yeshua because you show

us what truth is what mercy is and what

is wisdom I thank you Lord because you

give us this spirit the spirit of your

law which is the only thing that is

right the only thing that's correct that

we can understand that is according to

you thank you Lord because you prepare

us for your soon return because you take

away from us every fear and you shows

that those who obey and love your law

they will be protected and they will

inherit the earth

all this lord I thank you for for your

mercy for which thank you

only your mercy you shows the truth in

your precious name issuer HaMashiach

amen
